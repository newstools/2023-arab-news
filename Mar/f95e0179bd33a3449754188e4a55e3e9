RIYADH: Abdullah Al-Rabeeah, adviser to the Saudi Royal Court and supervisor general of the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center, met the Gulf Cooperation Council’s Secretary-General Jassem Mohamed Albudaiwi at KSrelief’s headquarters in Riyadh on Monday. Al-Rabeeah congratulated Albudaiwi on assuming his duties as secretary-general of the GCC, wishing him further success in his career. He also briefed Albudaiwi on the humanitarian and relief projects and programs offered by the Kingdom through the center to many needy and affected countries. He explained that KSrelief has helped 90 countries through 2,286 projects with a value of over $6 billion in cooperation with 175 international, regional, and local partners that include various relief and humanitarian sectors. Albudaiwi praised the pioneering Saudi efforts under the directives of King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, in providing all aspects of relief and humanitarian support to the 90 countries, which reflects Saudi Arabia’s approach of extending a helping hand to the needy around the world by providing assistance with accurate monitoring mechanisms and advanced transportation methods, directly or via partnerships with UN organizations and international and local NGOs. During the meeting, the two parties discussed many issues of common concern, including strengthening cooperation between KSrelief and the GCC General Secretariat through the Gulf Aid Coordination Office, over humanitarian relief projects provided by the GCC countries to Yemen.
