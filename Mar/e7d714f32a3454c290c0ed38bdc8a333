RIYADH: The EU delegation to Saudi Arabia and the Kingdom’s Museums Commission have completed a five-day workshop on “Museums and their role in our society,” organized by the National Museum of Saudi Arabia. Patrick Simonnet, the EU ambassador to the Kingdom, said the workshop was a success and thanked the Museums Commission and the Saudi Ministry of Culture for their cooperation. “The museums have a significant role to play in holding us to our roots in a world that is changing with increasingly accelerated speed,” he said. “We hope that this series of workshops highlight the importance of these places for the sake of all humanity.” Taghreed Al-Sarraj, general manager of education and talent development in the Museums Commission, said his organization was pleased to cooperate with the EU delegation. “We have enjoyed taking part in the organization of the workshop series, which will benefit students and educational institutions as well as those interested in history and culture.” Experts from the Egyptian Museum in Turin and from the Donnaregina Contemporary Art Museum in Naples gave lectures during the series. More workshops will be held in May and June.
