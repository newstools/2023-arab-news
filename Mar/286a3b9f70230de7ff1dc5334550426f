RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s King Salman sent a cable of condolences to Greece’s president Katerina Sakellaropoulou after two trains slammed into each other in northern Greece, killing at least 43 people, the Saudi Press Agency reported early Thursday. “We send to your excellency, the families of the deceased and the greek people, our deepest and sincere condolences,” the king said, wishing the injured a speedy recovery. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman also sent a similar cable to president Sakellaropoulou. The crash in Larissa crumpled carriages into twisted steel knots in the country’s worst-ever rail crash. The impact just before midnight Tuesday threw some passengers into ceilings and out the windows. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis called the collision of the passenger train and a freight train “a horrific rail accident without precedent in our country,” and pledged a full, independent investigation. He said it appears the crash was “mainly due to a tragic human error.”
