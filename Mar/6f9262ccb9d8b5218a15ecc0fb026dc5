Shahid customers in Egypt will be able to pay for their subscriptions using electronic wallets handled by Paymob, in addition to the existing option to pay using credit or debit cards. “We are thrilled to announce our latest partnership with Paymob, through which VF Cash will be the exclusive telco wallet for Shahid,” said Natasha Matos-Hemingway, Chief Commercial and Marketing Officer at Shahid. “This latest agreement is a testament to our commitment to providing innovative and accessible payment solutions to our customers, and with Paymob’s expertise, we are confident that this partnership will enable us to provide more convenient and secure subscription options for Shahid.” There are an estimated 25 million e-wallet users in Egypt.
