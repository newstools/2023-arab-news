KUWAIT CITY: The Japanese Gov. of Miyagi Yoshihiro Murai has passed on his country’s thanks to Kuwait for an oil-related aid package worth around $524 million donated in the aftermath of the devastating 2011 earthquake and tsunami.
The governor’s expression of gratitude came during an official visit to Miyagi by the Kuwaiti ambassador to Tokyo, Sami Al-Zamanan, the Kuwait News Agency reported on Tuesday.
The donation had helped to speed up reconstruction work after the disaster, Murai said.
He noted that his province had used part of its share to support the establishment of a partnership fund for medical studies, university of medicine, and a new building for the university’s hospital, all of which had helped address a shortage in medical staff in the governorate and neighboring areas.
Al-Zamanan said his visit underlined the continued strength of Kuwaiti-Japanese relations after 62 years of diplomatic ties.
On the donation, the envoy pointed out that it had been made by the late Emir of Kuwait Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, partly in appreciation of Japan’s position during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
And Kuwait was keen to further bolster relations between the two countries, Al-Zamanan added.
