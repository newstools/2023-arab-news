In the meeting, special assistant Hayashi expressed to the Houthis Japan’s strong hope that the parties to the conflict will make progress in the dialogue toward realizing a permanent peace in Yemen and urged them to renew the truce and reach a political solution to realize peace and stability in Yemen, according to the ministry.
