RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Ministry condemned on Friday the “extremist statements” made earlier this week by Israeli official Bezalel Smotrich to erase the village of Huwara in Palestine. The Ministry affirmed the Kingdom's “complete rejection” of the “racist and irresponsible statement,” which reflects the amount of “violence and extremism practiced by the occupying Israeli entity towards the brotherly Palestinian people,” in a statement released on Friday. It also stresseed its demand for the international community to asssume its repsonsibilities to deter “these shameful practices, stop escalation, and provide the necessary protection to civilians.”  #Statement | The Ministry of Foreign Affairs expresses the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's strong condemnation of the extremist statements made by an Israeli occupation official by demanding an (erase) of the Palestinian village of #Huwara. pic.twitter.com/YSSLOlVZqt — Foreign Ministry (@KSAmofaEN) March 3, 2023 Smotrich, whose party has made claims it wants Israel to formally annex large parts of the West Bank, later backtracked on his remarks.
