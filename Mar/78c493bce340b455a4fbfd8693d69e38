RIYADH: A team from the Saudi-based King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center on Friday delivered a financial donation to help those affected by the tsunami that hit the Hunga-Tonga Hunga-Ha’apai archipelago in Tongo, state news agency SPA reported on Saturday. An undersea volcano erupted in January last year, causing tsunami waves to flood the Pacific Island country, leaving entire towns inundated with water. KSrelief Director of Operations Department Faleh Al-Subaie and a representative of the Saudi embassy in Australia handed over the donation at the royal palace in the capital Nuku’alofa, in the presence of Queen Nanasipauʻu. The queen thanked and expressed gratitude to King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for their generosity and help to the tsunami victims, noting that her charity will utilize the funds to provide the necessary supplies to those in the resettlement areas. “A year on and we are still recovering and rebuilding and the re-settlement projects are ongoing. We are extremely fortunate to receive this donation at this time of urgent need.” she added. The queen expressed hope that good relations will be fostered with KSrelief and that further exchanges in other areas will be conducted. The gesture is part of Saudi Arabia’s humanitarian and relief efforts, through its humanitarian arm KSrelief, in support of the needy around world.
