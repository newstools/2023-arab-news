DHAHRAN: A musical tribute to the late Egyptian singer Umm Kulthum will on Tuesday open in Saudi Arabia. Produced and written by Saudi theater and film producer, Mona Khashoggi, “Umm Kulthum and the Golden Era” will be performed at Dhahran’s King Abdulaziz Center for World Culture, in Arabic with some English, which will be subtitled. The show, which has already been staged in Dubai and London, tells the story of the early life of the iconic singer, songwriter, and film actress. Born in 1898 on the Egyptian Delta into relative poverty, Kulthum rose from humble beginnings to transform herself into the Star of the Orient, her talent shining in Egypt and throughout the Arab-speaking world. Her father recognized her musical ability at a young age and disguised her as a boy so she could perform and make money to help feed the family. Kulthum, who died in Cairo in 1975, was mentored by the best composers and writers of the era and became a legend with her unique style and voice. The show, lasting for two hours and 20 minutes, will run at Ithra until March 17 — excluding March 12 and 13 — starting at 8 p.m. Tickets are priced from SR150 ($40) and can be purchased via the Ithra website or app. A 20 percent discount will apply for Ithra members.
