Amphetamines are largely used by young men and teenaged boys across the Middle East – but the money raised through the sale of all narcotics is not only used to further supply of the illegal drugs trade, but to fund other organized crime and terrorism. The recipient of the shipment, identified as a Syrian, was detained by authorities and referred to the public prosecution.  Enter
