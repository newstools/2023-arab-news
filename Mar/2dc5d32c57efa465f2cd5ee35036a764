RIYADH: Formula E driver Antonio Felix da Costa has described his recent Cape Town E-Prix victory as being among the greatest wins of his career and that he was determined to bring more success to his new team TAG Heuer Porsche. For the latest updates, follow us on Twitter @ArabNewsSport The 31-year-old season six champion went into the race on the back of a third-place finish in Hyderabad but having started in 11th, he worked his way through the top 10 and top three by lap 20. On lap 21, Da Costa then performed a stunning overtaking maneuver on Jean-Eric Vergne to seal a memorable race win. It was his first victory for Porsche since moving to the team last year and the Portuguese racer noted that the manner of the win was among his best. He said: “The last couple of months have been slightly tricky and took a small toll on me, so coming back to register a win like this is fantastic. “There have been a few other times where I’ve stood on top of a race car following this victory and I felt a huge amount of joy. All the ingredients came together so it’s super special. “If you combine everything in the process, then I would say it’s one of the most special wins I’ve ever had in my career,” he added. The next round of the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship will take place in Sao Paulo on March 25 and Da Costa believes the latest result for the team – a third of the season following Pascal Wehrlein’s two wins at the double-header Diriyah E-Prix – will give them confidence for the rest of the season. He said: “It’s quite hard joining a new team and I guess it’s the same for everyone else, so I am happy that I am able to do my talking on the track. “I’m still not fully happy with where we are but there are some good indications that we’re going in the right direction which is good. “It’s a huge honour to represent Porsche which is a big brand. They’ve got so many drivers, so I really want to leave a real mark on this team whenever I go out on the track,” Da Costa added.
