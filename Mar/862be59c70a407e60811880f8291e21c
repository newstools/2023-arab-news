DUBAI: Dubai’s Jumeirah Beach Hotel is launching the Ramadan Garden, which offers a more sustainable dining experience during the holy month. The venue is set to be a plastic-free Ramadan location, while all water served will be filtered at the resort’s bottling plant. Some 60 percent of the ingredients used in the menu will be sourced locally. The sustainable garden, with views of the Burj Al Arab, will be open seven days a week for iftar and suhoor. Jumeirah Group joined the Sustainable Hospitality Alliance in January, and plans to work with other world-class hotel brands to foster positive change in the industry.
