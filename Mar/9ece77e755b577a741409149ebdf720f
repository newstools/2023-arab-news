LONDON: Police in the UK are looking for a man believed to have set another man on fire outside a mosque in London.
The 82-year-old victim was doused in a flammable liquid before the suspect allegedly used a lighter to ignite it, causing severe burns, outside the West London Islamic Center on Feb. 27.
The Metropolitan Police released a photograph of the suspect who, they said, had engaged the victim in conversation for at least five minutes as they both left the mosque before launching the attack.
“I know this will be an incredibly shocking incident for the community, and we are carrying out a full investigation into what happened,” said Detective Sergeant Steven Constable.
“Understandably, there is a great deal of local concern in the wake of this incident and local officers have been carrying out reassurance patrols daily at the mosque.
“We are continuing to work alongside the West London Islamic Center who have been very supportive of our investigation and have been assisting us with our inquiries. A key part of that is identifying the man in the image we have released.”
