DUBAI: The Government of Japan contributed 147 million yen (about US$1.1 million) to the UN’s World Food Programme (WFP) in Jordan to provide nutrition-sensitive food assistance to more than 27,000 Syrian refugees living in camps and host communities for one month. The Ambassador of Japan to Jordan, OKUYAMA Jiro, announced the contribution during a joint field visit to a Syrian beneficiary family receiving WFP’s monthly food assistance in Jordan’s capital Amman. “WFP is grateful for the continued support of the people and Government of Japan. With overlapping crises and natural disasters around the world making communities more vulnerable, Japan’s new contribution ensures that some of the most vulnerable refugees living in Jordan do not fall deeper into food insecurity,” said WFP Representative and Country Director, Alberto Correia Mendes. “Amid increasing global food price, the Government of Japan acknowledges the alarming levels of food insecurity and the heightened vulnerability of refugees in Jordan. We hope our assistance, in collaboration with WFP, will support the food security and nutrition of vulnerable populations, particularly female-headed households and families with persons of disabilities,” Ambassador Okuyama said. 465,000 refugees in Jordan are currently receiving monthly cash-based assistance from WFP to help meet their basic food needs. Refugees residing in communities receive 2,800 yen (about US$21) per person per month, while extremely vulnerable families living in camps and local communities, receive 4,300 yen (about US$32) per person per month. Over the past ten years, Japan has contributed more than 5 billion yen (about US$36 million) to support WFP’s activities in Jordan. This includes supporting direct food assistance and livelihood activities and enhancing food security for Jordanians and refugees at risk. - This article was originally published on Arab News Japan
