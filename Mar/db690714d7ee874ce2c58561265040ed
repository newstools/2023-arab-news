A post shared by Queen Rania Al Abdullah (@queenrania) “So much love in one room! With friends and family at Iman’s Henna party yesterday,” Queen Rania captioned the post, which featured photographs of Princess Iman in a white gown by fashion designer Reema Dahbour as well as a belt that Queen Rania wore during her own wedding to King Abdullah II in 1993. Thermiotis graduated in 2015 with a specialization in Business Administration and Business from Florida International University. He led a venture capital firm named Outbound Ventures LLC after graduating, before moving to a New York based Venture Capital fund.
