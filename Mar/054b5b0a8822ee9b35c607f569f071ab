DUBAI: Women violating the Islamic dress code will be punished, Iran’s Judiciary Chief Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei said on Monday according to the official IRNA news agency.
Following the death of Iranian Kurdish young woman Mahsa Amini by Iran’s morality police for flouting the country’s strict dress code on Sept. 16, Iran was faced with nationwide protests that represented one of the toughest challenges to the Islamic Republic since its establishment in 1979.
