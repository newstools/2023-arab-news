RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Justice concluded on Monday its inaugural International Conference on Justice in Riyadh. The two-day gathering brought together 50 jurists, legal experts, and decision makers from around the world to discuss how technology was transforming legal systems and making justice more transparent and accessible to all. Saudi Minister of Justice Walid Al-Samaani said: “The past two days have been a huge success, as we were able to exchange knowledge and expertise with the brightest legal minds from around the globe. “Our hope is that the dialogue and cooperation fostered during this conference will go on to have a significant impact on the future development of digital justice solutions globally.” Featuring 25 speakers and six main sessions, the conference invited participants to engage under the title, “Facilitating Access to Justice Through Digital Innovation.” Topics covered ranged from the role of digitalization in enhancing preventative justice to the future of artificial intelligence in the practice of law and the use of mass data to predict judicial outcomes. Through the conference, the Kingdom sought to provide legal stakeholders globally with an important new platform to exchange expertise on digital transformation and foster international cooperation on the digital future of legal systems. Since the launch of Vision 2030, Saudi digitalization efforts have established the country as a global leader in digital justice. More than 90 percent of the Kingdom’s judicial services have now been digitalized, with the Ministry of Justice’s Najiz portal providing users with access to at least 150 judicial e-services. Over the past year, the Kingdom’s expanding digital services have facilitated more than 2.37 million online hearings, rendered in excess of 1.1 million judgements, and issued at least 5.2 million e-powers of attorney.
