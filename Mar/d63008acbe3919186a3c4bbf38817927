LONDON: A British Muslim has completed five international marathons to raise money for a global emergency response appeal, with one left to go before he reaches his target. “With the Tokyo Marathon now under his belt, Ashraf Wallace, who runs for the UK-based international charity Penny Appeal, is just one race away from joining the exclusive ‘Six Star Finisher’ club, a highly coveted achievement in the running community,” the charity said. To become a Six Star Finisher, runners must complete all six of the world’s major marathons, including Tokyo, Boston, London, Berlin, Chicago and New York City. Wallace, who says he is “running the world to save lives,” is now setting his sights on the Boston Marathon, which is scheduled to take place next year. “He is confident in his ability to conquer the course and become one of the few runners in the world to achieve the coveted Six Star Finisher status,” Penny Appeal said. “I’m thrilled to have completed the Tokyo Marathon and, more importantly, to have raised funds for Penny Appeal’s Turkiye/Syria earthquake appeal, which is such an important cause,” said Wallace. I can’t believe I’m doing it to myself again, I’m sure it won’t only be Tokyo there will be more so please continue to support me like you have been. https://t.co/XaMrnhouvg https://t.co/Qmk9An4gnh — Ashraf Wallace (@AshrafWallace) November 17, 2022 “I’m now looking forward to the Boston Marathon and the opportunity to join the exclusive Six Star Finisher club. It’s been a long and challenging journey, but I’m determined to see it through.” Adeem Younis, Penny Appeal’s founder, said: “Ash’s dedication to his sport, and his commitment to charitable causes such as the Turkiye/Syria emergency appeal, make him a true inspiration to runners, as well as many people in his local community and beyond. “We congratulate him on his successful completion of the Tokyo Marathon and wish him the best of luck as he prepares for the Boston Marathon.”
