RIYADH: The charity Ensan has set a target to provide SR4 million ($1 million) worth of food baskets to orphans and their families during Ramadan. Under the theme “Feed an Orphan During the Holy Month,” the scheme hopes to benefit about 10,000 people in families that have lost parents. To preserve the dignity of the recipients, the value of the food basket will be deposited into the families’ bank accounts, rather than being gifted as a physical item. This would also allow families to buy the items they most needed or wanted during the holy month, the charity said. Any members of the public who would like to support the scheme can do so via Ensan’s donation platform, by bank transfer or at any of the charity’s outlets. Besides the “Feed an Orphan” scheme, Ensan runs a number of other charitable efforts, including Zakat Al-Fitr, Zakat money and Eid gifts, as well as providing winter clothing and schoolbags.
