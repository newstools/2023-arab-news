RIYADH: Two relief planes carrying 168 tons of aid from Saudi Arabia to the people of Ukraine departed from King Khalid International Airport, the Saudi Press Agency reported on Friday.
The planes left in the morning for Rzeszow Airport in Poland, near the Ukrainian border.
The freight consists of shelter materials, electric generators and medical supplies, which will be delivered across the Polish border into Ukraine.
Last week, the Kingdom signed in coordination with the Polish government and UN organizations a memorandum of understanding to provide an additional package of humanitarian assistance to Ukraine worth $400 million.
Saudi Arabia previously provided urgent medical and relief aid worth $10 million for refugees fleeing Ukraine to neighboring countries, particularly Poland.
