Lavish fabrics were on full display on the opening night of Dubai Fashion Week. Anomalous Dubai-based label Anomalous unveiled a collaboration with toy brand Hot Wheels. Bomber jackets with patchwork badges, reimagined formal wear and colourful racing-inspired garments marked the collection. Maison du Mec The Lebanese label’s runway presentation was inspired by minimalism and modern art. The collection took everyday essentials and elevated them into sophisticated yet simple pieces — think tailored jackets, flowy fabrics and futuristic designs.   MOK Inside out coats, jute-top stitched pockets and cubic patchwork jackets came together in the “Elsewhere” collection which was inspired by the notion of recollecting one’s memories. BHYPE The streetwear brand put on a fun show, with models arriving in limos to showcase a vibrant collection of track suits, radiant mesh outfits, and denim for both men and women.
