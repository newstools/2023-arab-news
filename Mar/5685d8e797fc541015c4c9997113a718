JEDDAH: NEOM has concluded preparations to host the first race of Season 3 of the all-electric off-roading series Extreme E. For the third consecutive year, Saudi Arabia will serve as the host country for the international racing series, with the Desert X Prix taking place on March 11-12, featuring 10 international teams competing over the course of two days. Extreme E races take place in destinations affected by climate change around the world, with the five races promoting the trend toward the use of electric vehicles and supporting efforts to reduce carbon emissions and create a better future for the planet. For the second consecutive year, the series will return to NEOM, where the drivers will race across desert landscapes, with male and female drivers from each team driving the Odyssey 21 electric car over the duration of the two days of competition. Teams The teams confirmed for the races are ABT Cupra XE, Acciona — Sainz XE Team, Andretti Altawkilat Extreme E, Carl Cox Motorsport, JBXE, NEOM McLaren Extreme E, NO.99 GMC Hummer EV Chip Ganassi, Rosberg X Racing, Veloce Racing, and X44 Vida Carbon Racing Race Format Each X Prix will now be a doubleheader and play host to back-to-back rounds across the weekend. This means double the opportunity for wins, podiums and crucial points across the 10-race calendar over the course of the campaign, crucially without adding any additional carbon footprint, in line with the goal of the series to keep carbon emissions to a minimum. If any teams are tied in the qualifying standings, their positioning will be determined by their time in the Continental Traction Challenge — the team with the quicker run through the allocated sector during qualifying will receive the higher overall position. An ENOWA Hyperdrive boost will also be available to all drivers in the race. Activated when the driver presses a button on their steering wheel, they will enjoy an increase in power for a fixed amount of time — the timing for this will be a key decision. Championship points: Following the Grand Final and Redemption Race, points will be awarded to teams as follows: Grand Final 1st place 25 points 2nd place 18 points 3rd place 15 points 4th place 12 points 5th place 10 points Redemption Race 6th place 8 points 7th place 6 points 8th place 4 points 9th place 2 points 10th place 1 point The Continental Traction Challenge The Continental Traction Challenge returns in 2023 and is set to be crucial to the overall points total once again. The team that sets the fastest time, a combination of both the male and female drivers’ fastest times, through the allocated sector, will win the Continental Traction Challenge and earn two championship points. This will run for each of the individual race days on Saturday and Sunday.
