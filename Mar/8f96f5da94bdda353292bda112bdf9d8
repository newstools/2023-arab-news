CAIRO: Sameh Shoukry, the Egyptian minister of foreign affairs, met the UN’s special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, in Cairo on Monday. Ahmed Abu Zeid, a spokesperson for the ministry, wrote in a message posted on Twitter that there is “continuous coordination between Egypt and the UN for advancing the political solution in Syria and alleviating the suffering of the Syrian brotherly people.” Shoukry pledged Egypt’s full support for Pedersen’s efforts to bring about peace in Syria, and they agreed to continue their consultations and coordination. The minister reiterated the importance of reviving the political process, within the framework of Egypt’s desire to resolve the Syrian crisis as quickly as possible, in accordance with international resolutions. He also briefed the UN envoy about the aid and support provided for Syria following the devastating earthquakes that hit the country and neighboring Turkiye in February. Earlier on Monday, Arab League spokesperson Jamal Rushdi said the organization’s secretary-general, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, held talks with Pedersen within the framework of ongoing consultations between the League and the UN, during which the latest developments in Syria were discussed. On the specific issue of Syria’s return to the Arab League, Rushdi said it is too early to talk about that happening. He added that Aboul Gheit and Pedersen emphasized the importance of continuing efforts to break the political stalemate in the Syrian crisis. Shoukry visited Syria in February, following the earthquakes, to convey a message of solidarity from Cairo. It was the first visit to Syria by an Egyptian foreign minister since the civil war began in 2011. “The goal of my visit to Damascus is primarily humanitarian,” Shoukry said at the time.
