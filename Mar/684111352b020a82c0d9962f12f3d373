RIYADH: ROSHN, a Public Investment Fund-owned real estate developer, has launched its first project in the Eastern Province, ALFULWA, with a capacity to house 100,000 people. Located 7 km from the center of Al-Ahsa, the project will feature 18,000 residential units spread over an area of 10.8 million sq. m. “We are delighted to put our footprint in the Eastern Province, especially in Al-Ahsa Governorate, with ALFULWA project. This project reflects ROSHN’s dedication to enhancing the urban landscape across the Kingdom,” David Grover, CEO at ROSHN, said. Built near Dakhna Mountain and Al-Qarah Mountain, ALFULWA project aims to incorporate the cultural and geographical heritage of the region into its design while providing urban facilities, it said in a press release. In its design and construction, ALFULWA aims to move forward with its sustainability practices by contributing to an 18 percent reduction in energy consumption costs. “Over the next few years, our objective is to create residential developments that provide the Saudi community with access to modern amenities in a sustainable and natural environment,” added Grover. ALFULWA project marks the fourth community launched by ROSHN, following the successful introduction of SEDRA and WAREFAH in Riyadh and ALAROUS in Jeddah.
