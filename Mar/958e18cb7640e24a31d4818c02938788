A post shared by [NGFJ] (@nadineghosnjewelry) “It is my very first time exhibiting in the Middle East, and it is truly exciting — as is the unveiling of my new collection Youtensils,” Ghosn said in a statement. Ghosn’s collection, along with some of her most famous fine jewelry pieces, will be available for in-person shopping for three days at Sotheby’s Dubai and will be on Sotheby’s website for a month. The designer launched her brand in 2016. A post shared by [NGFJ] (@nadineghosnjewelry) In a previous interview with Arab News, Ghosn said that her love of accessories stems from her childhood, particularly when her father — the former Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn — would return with gifts from his travels. In her teens, she recalls, “I always spent my money on jewelry. I couldn’t care less about what I was wearing but I would always accessorize it in a specific way.” Having majored in art and economics, Ghosn began her career in a New York consulting firm, followed by a rotational program at Hermès. Once she had gained a deeper understanding of craftsmanship, Ghosn turned down a major job offer to begin her own independent career path. Over the years, a number of celebrities have been spotted wearing Ghosn’s pieces. Beyoncé wore the tongue-in-cheek Shut Up earring cuff for her 35th birthday celebrations, and Karl Lagerfeld has sported the Can You Hear Me? headphones necklace.
