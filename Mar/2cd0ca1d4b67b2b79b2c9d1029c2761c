With a capacity of 79.2 million cubic meters of water, the Wadi Qanuna Dam is considered one of the Kingdom’s largest barrages.
The structure, which is 326 meters long and 70 meters high, contains a water purification plant with a daily production capacity of 18,000 cubic meters. Once treated, the water travels to the beneficiary areas.
Located within Qanuna Valley, one of the country’s most beautiful areas, water flows from the dam through the valley all year round, with farms, palm and perennial trees spread along its sides.
The site is a popular tourist destination, especially during winter, and the valley is characterized not only by its running water and natural beauty, but also unique rock formations and archaeological inscriptions, plus bankside Habasha market.
A road runs along the sides of the dam allowing visitors the chance to view the breathtaking scenery.
Al-Ardyat is one of Makkah region’s governorates and is in the far south between Al-Baha and Asir in the Tihama area. It has a rich cultural heritage and a rapidly developing tourism sector.
