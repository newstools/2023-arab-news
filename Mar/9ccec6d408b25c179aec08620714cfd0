Various news outlets and magazines have covered Khatib’s achievements, and she also appeared on the cover of Women’s Running Magazine in October 2016. Khatib has dedicated her marathon run to fundraising for Penny Appeal’s emergency work for Turkish and Syrian earthquake victims. Penny Appeal, which is based in Yorkshire, works to provide aid and relief to those living in poverty around the world and their emergency aid helps those affected by natural disasters, war and conflict. “Rahaf’s dedication and passion for helping others, with Penny Appeal’s support, will make a difference to the lives of those affected by the earthquake. The funds raised through Rahaf’s efforts will go toward providing water, food, and essential supplies to those in need, the charity said. “We are proud to have Rahaf support Penny Appeal and we hope that together will we be able to raise funds to help victims of the earthquake in Turkiye and Rahaf’s home nation of Syria where thousands of people have lost their lives and millions have been displaced,” it added. Khatib said: “I hope to inspire other hijabis and stay-at-home moms to get out there. I hope to see major fitness retailers represent us covered sisters in their ads and cater to our modest fitness needs. Wearing the hijab means I’m guarding my modesty and respecting my body out of deep devotion to my faith.”  A post shared by Rahaf khatib (@runlikeahijabi)
