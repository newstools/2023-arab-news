DUBAI: Blinx, which describes itself as the first digital hub for native storytelling in the Middle East and North Africa region, launched on Tuesday.
It aims to deliver “more story, less noise” through content created by and for youth, according to its founders.
The company will be led by General Manager Nakhle Elhage, a media professional with nearly 15 years of experience as director of news and current affairs at Al Arabiya.
“Our purpose is to inspire the youth through honest, genuine and spectacular storytelling,” he said. “By providing news, entertainment and infotainment, powered by the best tech and people available, we will help build a better tomorrow.”
Blinx said its offices in Dubai have metaverse and extended-reality studios and production facilities, along with control rooms equipped with the latest live production tools, including AI-enhanced technology for analyzing video and data.
“Throughout history, storytelling has always been embedded in our culture,” said Elhage. “By being innovative and breaking the mold of traditional infotainment, Blinx will harness the collective power of resources, tech and expertise, so that storytelling feels fresh, exciting and relevant to today’s youth.”
The company said it will distribute content primarily through its online portal and social media channels, and will soon launch a digital app for smart devices. The content it produces will span a range of categories, including entertainment and infotainment; news and current affairs; sports; lifestyle; adventure; music; mental health and self-development; and climate change. It also plans to “gamify,” in other words add elements more usually associated with game playing, to its content to encourage engagement.
“Engaging the region’s talented, bold and brave storytellers, our new digital hub aims to be the go-to destination for stories that connect young people in MENA to the world and like-minded communities,” Elhage said.
