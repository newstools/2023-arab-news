DUBAI: Morocco's position regarding the Palestinian issue is irreversible and it constitutes one of the priorities of the kingdom’s foreign policy, the Moroccan Royal Court said in a statement issued Monday. “For Morocco, this is a constant, principled position, which should not be open to political posturing and narrow electoral campaigns,” the royal court statement added in a reference to the Palestinians issue. The court said the statement responds to recent remarks by the General Secretariat of the Justice and Development Party (PJD) containing “irresponsible excessive views and dangerous approximations” concerning the relations between Morocco and Israel, against the background of the latest developments in Palestinian territories. “The Kingdom's international relations cannot be the subject of blackmail by anyone or for any consideration whatsoever, particularly in the current complex global context. The instrumentalization of the Kingdom's foreign policy in a domestic partisan agenda thus constitutes a dangerous, unacceptable precedent.”
