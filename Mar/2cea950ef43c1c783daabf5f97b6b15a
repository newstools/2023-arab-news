WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden on Thursday offered his condolences over the train accident in Greece that killed at least 47 people and injured dozens of others.
A passenger train collided head-on with a freight train outside the central Greek city of Larissa before midnight on Tuesday.
“On behalf of the American people, Jill and I send our deepest condolences to the families of the victims who lost their lives in the tragic train accident in Greece,” Biden said on Twitter.
“We wish those injured a quick and full recovery.”
On Wednesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke by telephone with his Greek counterpart Nikolaos Dendias, telling him “that the United States stands with the people of Greece during this difficult time.”
At least 47 people have been confirmed dead by Greek authorities, but several more are known to have been trapped in the restaurant car and have yet to be extricated.
Investigators blamed the tragedy on human error and a 59-year-old station manager was arrested on suspicion on negligent homicide for allowing the freight train to travel on the same track in the opposite direction as the passenger train.
The government also acknowledged delays in installing safeguards on the train route, citing “chronic malaise and decades of failure” in state management.
