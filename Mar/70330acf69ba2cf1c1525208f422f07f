The athlete from Togo is now attempting his biggest challenge to date — to run across all seven emirates of the UAE in the fastest known time, beating the previous record set in 2021 of 6 days, 21 hours, 48 minutes The runner, who is an Adidas employee and running coach at LK Running Performance in Dubai, is a well-known figure at community races and is often seen on the sidelines handing out water, cheering competitors or running alongside first-time runners to support them. Souleymane has lived in Dubai since 2017 and is bidding to set new standards in a challenge first attempted in 2006 by Jalal Jamal Majid Bin Thaneya Al-Marri. Souleymane said: “I’m fortunate to have been born with a gift for endurance and sports. “I am passionate about encouraging everyone to harness the benefits of fitness and sport to make themselves mentally and physically stronger. “I believe it is part of my duty to give back to others, and so I will be attempting to beat the existing world record for the fastest crossing of the UAE on foot, in the name of raising money for the Heroes of Hope charity, in association with Al Jalila Foundation.” Souleymane will be running through Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm Al-Quwain, Ras Al-Khaimah, and Fujairah from Tuesday, and hopes to finish in triumphant fashion on March 11.
