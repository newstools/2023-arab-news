AMMAN: The Jordanian Senate’s Palestine Committee has reiterated its call for inter-Palestinian reconciliation and unity to face blatant Israeli aggression, Jordan’s News Agency reported on Wednesday.
In a statement, the committee referenced Israel’s violent operations against the Palestinian people in the West Bank, Jerusalem and Gaza, in conjunction with incursions by the Israeli army and Jewish settlers into cities of Nablus, Jenin and Hawara, which led to numerous people being injured.
Headed by Nayef Qadi, the committee said hundreds of extremist Jewish settlers stormed Al-Aqsa Mosque and carried out provocative activities and rituals under the protection of Israeli police.
Decrying Israel’s measures against the Palestinians, the committee said that such activities undermine a just settlement to end Arab-Israeli conflict by establishing a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital on the June 4, 1967 borders.
At the same time, the committee praised the “remarkable” efforts made by Jordan’s diplomacy to achieve a solution that meets Palestinians’ aspirations and restores their full rights of sovereignty, dignity and independent will.
The committee lauded Jordanian King Abdullah’s efforts and his calls to reach a fair settlement by returning to negotiations, as was the case in the recent Aqaba meeting, the ensuing agreement of which Israel has refused to implement.
