DUBAI: TikTok has launched an in-app learning content hub, called “School Ready,” to bring together entertainment and education. The company has partnered with several e-learning platforms such as Abwaab, Noon Academy and Nafham in Saudi Arabia and Egypt to spotlight high school education and exam preparation content through the hub. In addition to providing access to e-learning platforms, the hub will also offer short courses and exam tips. A dedicated landing page will serve as the main location to showcase school education and tutoring content around various subjects for Grade 10 to Grade 12 students.  TikTok’s e-learning partners will regularly publish educational videos and curriculum-related updates on the platform. The hub will also include partner accounts, and other content from educational creators covering subjects such as math, science and language, and issues such as time management and pre-exam anxiety. Users will be able to share feedback in the suggestions box regarding any educational content they would like to see. The move is part of TikTok’s efforts to combine education and entertainment by providing credible content through partnerships with verified institutes.
