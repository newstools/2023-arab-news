RIYADH: Anyone who promotes, whether intentionally or otherwise, fraudulent statements attributed to MBC Group’s channels about the TV series “Muawiya” could face legal action, said the group in a statement on Wednesday. This came after fake content carrying MBC logos was circulated by several news outlets and shared on social media platforms. MBC Group highlighted that the historical drama about Umayyad Caliph Muawiyah bin Abi Sufyan was still in production, adding that the release date would be announced as soon as the series was ready. The only legitimate news related to MBC is that which is officially issued and distributed by the media office of the group’s headquarters, the Saudi media company stressed in its statement. MBC Group also emphasized that the only reliable sources of information about MBC’s productions, shows, program schedules, and media content are its official outlets, including MBC’s TV channels, platforms, and social media accounts.
