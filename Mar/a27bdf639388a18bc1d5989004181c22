The data revealed a 12.75 percent jump in exported boxes at 194,157 TEUs, compared to 172,208 TEUs in 2022. Imported containers stood at 193,937 TEUs, a 5.95 percent surge relative to last year’s 183,051 TEUs. Transshipments also edged up by 5.39 percent to 193,937 TEUs against the previous year’s tally of 183,051 TEUs. However, non-containerized cargo saw a 3.13 percent drop to 23,089,455 tons this year from 23,835,826 tons in February 2022.
