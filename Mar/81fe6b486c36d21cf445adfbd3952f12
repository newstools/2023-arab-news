RIYADH: Amazon has made it easier for Saudi businesses to access hundreds of millions of new customers by rolling out its international registration system across the Kingdom. Speaking to Arab News on the sidelines of the Biban 2023 event, the firm’s Saudi Country Manager Abdo Chlala said the Amazon Global Registration system would enable small and medium enterprises in the Kingdom to grow. “With Amazon Global Registration now with a simple registration in the Kingdom, they have access to the 21 Amazon stores available globally,” he said. Chlala noted that through the global registration system, sellers’ exposure will now transition from a reach of a few million customers to hundreds of millions across the world. “And this enables sellers to scale faster and also to learn about their proposition and their customer reaction to that across the globe,” he added, as he also stressed the wide scope of businesses on the platform. Chlala further noted that the company provides sellers with tools that ease the onboarding process and ultimately selling on Amazon. “We also have an Amazon Seller Central, which is the hub of information for sellers, which basically gives them a full and comprehensive understanding on every input,” he said. The seller central provides information about the units, inventory, and prices as well as gives recommendations to sellers to reach more consumers and increase their engagement. Amazon marketplace, an e-commerce platform that enables third-party sellers to sell products, makes up over 50 percent of total customer sales on the site, he said. In 2022, Amazon signed a memorandum of understanding with Saudi Arabia’s Small and Medium Enterprises General Authority, also known as Monsha’at, with the core focus of supporting 45,000 SMEs and enabling them to sell on Amazon.
