RIYADH: International construction engineering firm Egis is set to acquire Saudi-based architectural and engineering consultancy Omrania, according to a statement. Egis has played a vital role in several iconic projects dispersed around the Kingdom while working closely with key clients such as The Royal Commission of Riyadh City, NEOM, Diriyah Gate Development Authority, Red Sea Global, among several others. The move will see 700 workers from Omrania joining Egis, giving it a Middle East workforce of more than 3,000. The acquisition cements both firms’ efforts in helping propel and achieve Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030. “With the addition of Omrania, Egis will create a true leadership position in high-end design and architecture services in Saudi Arabia,” Group CEO of Egis Laurent Germain said. “Together with Omrania’s team, we have a shared vision to design sustainable and contextual environments that enrich the quality of everyday life,” he added. Omrania has experience working with government entities, cultural institutions, and private sector organizations, and the deal is an opportunity to leverage both companies’ joint footprint and client base in an attempt to reach substantial scale in the Kingdom. “Egis and Omrania have been working together since 2013 and this step will surely bring together the best that both offer to our clients and ourselves,” said Basem Al-Shihabi, founder and managing partner of Omrania.
