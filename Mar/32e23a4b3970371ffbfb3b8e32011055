RIYADH: The third relief plane carrying 30 tons of aid from Saudi Arabia to the people of Ukraine departed from King Khalid International Airport in Riyadh. The plane left on Saturday morning for Rzeszow Airport in Poland, near the Ukrainian border. The freight, which includes shelter materials, electric generators and medical supplies, will be delivered across the Polish border into Ukraine. Last week, the Kingdom signed an agreement and a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to provide additional humanitarian aid to Ukraine worth $400 million, which includes humanitarian aid worth $100 million. The Kingdom previously provided urgent medical and shelter aid worth $10 million for refugees fleeing Ukraine to neighboring countries, notably Poland, in coordination with the Polish government and UN organizations.
