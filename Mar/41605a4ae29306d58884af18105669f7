LONDON: A personal trainer from the UK has pleaded guilty to sharing far-right terrorist documents online, including the manifesto of Christchurch mosque killer Brenton Tarrant. Kristofer Thomas Kearney, 38, who used the name “Charlie Big Potatoes” on social media, was a member of the far-right group Patriotic Alternative and is thought to be the first to be convicted of terror offenses, the Daily Telegraph reported. He was extradited from Spain last year after being accused of posting a slew of terrorist content on social media, including Tarrant’s manifesto and writings from far-right Norwegian mass killer Anders Breivik. The 38-year-old appeared at the Old Bailey by video link from Chelmsford prison, pleading guilty to two offenses of disseminating terrorist publications. His motivation for posting the content will be determined in May hearings, Judge Richard Marks said. The court heard that Kearney used Telegram in 2021 to distribute a bulleted list of 89 extremist documents, including the Tarrant manifesto. The court also heard that he was formerly a member of proscribed far-right group National Action, leaving the outfit before it was banned in 2016.
