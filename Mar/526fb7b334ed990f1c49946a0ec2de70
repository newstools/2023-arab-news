Golf is a wonderful sport for Saudi women and I encourage as many women as possible to try it out and enjoy a social day with their friends on the golf course.” The launch of the Ladies First Club was announced in November 2020 during the inaugural Aramco Saudi Ladies International, the first major professional sporting event for women to take place in Saudi Arabia. Within the days of the announcement, more than 1,000 women registered an interest in learning to play golf. “I am grateful to have had the chance to become a member of the Ladies First Club,” Al-Mubaraki added. “I love competing in local tournaments and, although it can be a little daunting at first, with each one your confidence grows and grows. This win is something that I’m sure I’ll never forget.” Over the past two and a half years, numerous women have taken part in coaching programs and other golf lessons at Nofa Golf Resort, Riyadh Golf Club, Dirab Golf and Country Club, and at Royal Greens Golf and Country Club in King Abdullah Economic City, Jeddah.
