RIYADH: A delegation from the International Monetary Fund on Monday visited Saudi Arabia’s first virtual hospital in Riyadh. Seha Virtual Hospital was launched in February 2022 as part of the Kingdom’s efforts to digitize its healthcare sector, which forms part of the nation’s Vision 2030 program. The mission was briefed on the virtual health services provided by the hospital and its experience in using the latest technologies to do so.   Seha Virtual Hospital aims to improve upon and promote the culture of virtual medicine in healthcare and provide the best virtual health services at the national and international levels. Connected to more than 150 hospitals and covering over 35 subspecialties throughout Saudi Arabia, Seha Virtual Hospital claims to be the largest of its kind in the world and the first in the Middle East and North Africa region. Patients no longer need to travel to different parts of the Kingdom to be seen by specialized physicians and are not limited to regular clinic hours. Unlike simple video calls with doctors, the virtual hospital allows patients to visit their local hospital and attend a real-time live video clinical session with top specialists from across the Kingdom. During the session, vital signs, tests and X-rays can be taken and shared with a network of specialists. Emergency interventions can be provided around the clock, with top physicians able to guide local junior staff through complex cases.
