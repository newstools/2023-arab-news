AMMAN: The Jordanian Businessmen Association (JBA) and a visiting delegation of Jordanian-Australian businessmen have discussed prospects of forging closer investment cooperation and expanding trade relations between both countries’ private sectors.
Addressing the delegation on Saturday, JBA President Hamdi Tabbaa said that Jordan looks forward to attracting more foreign investment, especially from Australia, through cementing relations between the private sectors in both countries, reported Jordan’s News Agency.
Economic relations with Australia saw “remarkable development” in recent years, said Tabbaa, adding: “We aspire to see them further prosper in a manner that reflects on the volume of trade exchange and investment.”
He outlined key investment opportunities in mega projects and the need to promote ventures, noting strong bilateral relations, particularly in tourism, health care and education.
JBA’s head called on Australian businesspeople to visit Jordan and see firsthand productivity and service projects in the industrial estates and development areas, as well as the possibility for investors to benefit from the Australian Investment Environment Law of 2022 and the advantages and incentives it offers.
Shawkat Maslamani, who headed the Australian team, hoped that the visit would help consolidate his country’s relations with Jordan and the Middle East, and the provision of aid in various fields, including education and health and the transfer of knowledge in various industries, namely Australia’s expertise in vocational education.
The two sides called for eliminating barriers to cooperation, launching joint ventures in promising sectors and benefiting from economic advantages and incentives offered by both countries.
