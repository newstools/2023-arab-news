RIYADH: The Diriyah Gate Development Authority has launched a market at a park in Turaif as part of the economic revitalization of the historic district. Vendors at the market called “Souq Al-Mawsim,” open from Wednesday to Saturday each week until the end of May, will offer a wide range of items including food, sweets, coffee, fresh produce, perfume and clothes, the Saudi Press Agency reported. The historic town of Diriyah is emerging as one of the Kingdom’s top cultural and entertainment destinations. Its Turaif district, site of the first Saudi capital, was added to UNESCO’s World Heritage List in 2010. The DGDA works to preserve the cultural heritage of the area to strengthen national identity and Saudis’ understanding of their history and ancestors.  Enter
