The village of Laynah, located 105 km south of Rafha in the Saudi Northern Borders region, is one of the most important historical sites in the Kingdom due to its ancient water wells. The wells, which are thousands of years old, are the subject of legends and stories explaining their origin, drawing tourists and visitors from across Saudi Arabia. According to researcher and heritage and antiquities expert Abdulrahman bin Mohammed Al-Tuwaijri, local legends say that the wells are among the oldest in the north of the Arabian Peninsula. Al-Tuwaijri told SPA that the wells were carved in distinct shapes across the solid rocky soil of the local village, but only a few of the 300 original wells remain in the area. Tour guide Khalaf bin Jabal Al-Shammari told SPA that much of the information on the Laynah wells is based on hearsay. “There is no academic research on these wells, but many stories and references confirm that the historical number of wells is estimated at more than 300 spread on a hard rocky height, dating back tens of thousands of years. It has not been proven historically who dug them, as many ancient civilizations lived in the region as evidenced by the archaeological treasure trove of Hegra.” Al-Shammari said that Laynah is one of the most important archaeological sites and one of the oldest settlements in the Arabian Peninsula. The village is located on the ancient trade route between Najd and Iraq, and throughout history provided traveling caravan convoys with respite from harsh desert conditions.
