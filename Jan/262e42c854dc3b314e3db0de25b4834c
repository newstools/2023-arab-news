DUBAI: Netflix is continuing its investment in regional content with the launch of its latest series “Scattered Barriers.” Scheduled to air on Jan. 12, the Omani series features local talent Amina Abdel Rasoul, Ibrahim Al Zadjali, Essam Al Zadjali, Balqis Al Balushi and Raed Al Ameri, along with Emirati actor Salama Al Mazrouei. It is directed by award-winning director Adbelbary Adulkhair — known for shows like “Dreams Drawn by Dust” and “Al Hasan and Al Husein” — and filmed by cinematographer Susan Lumsdon. The series sheds light on the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on human behavior and society. The lead character, Nasser, is a taxi driver who denies the severity of the virus until he loses his mother to it. The six-episode series is set in Oman but was shot in Al Ain in the UAE. “Scattered Barriers” is the latest show in Netflix’s content strategy for the Middle East, with other recent examples being “Dubai Bling,” and “The Cage,” a comedy-drama and its first Kuwaiti series.
