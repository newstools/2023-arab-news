RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s  Jeddah Islamic Port has received a new batch of three ship-to-shore cranes amid efforts to boost operational efficiency of the port, the Saudi Press Agency reported. The new cranes have been procured by the Red Sea Gateway Terminal, which is  a strategic partner of the Jeddah port and the operator of its North Container Terminal. The cranes cement the Red Sea Gateway Terminal’s commitment to upscale the terminal’s operations and modernize its logistics infrastructure. Earlier this month, the Saudi Ports Authority , also known as Mawani, announced that Geneva-based international liner operator Mediterranean Shipping Co. has added Jeddah Islamic Port to its new India-West Mediterranean route. The new service falls in line with the objectives of the National Strategy for Transport and Logistics Services that aims to consolidate the Kingdom’s position as a global logistics hub connecting three continents. Industries between India and the Mediterranean such as clothing, automotive, and pharmaceutical are set to benefit from the new direct communication between the two regions. Last year, in October, Mawani inked a deal with Globe Group to establish a fully integrated logistics zone at the Jeddah port to enhance its competitive edge and support logistics-related companies on the ground.
