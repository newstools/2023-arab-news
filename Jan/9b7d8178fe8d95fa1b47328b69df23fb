YANBU: Yanbu Education Department celebrated World Braille Day, which falls on Jan. 4.
The day is marked to raise awareness of Braille as a means of communication with the blind and visually impaired. It also encourages visually impaired individuals to read and write and consolidate their actual presence in their communities.
Abdullah bin Farha Al-Ghamdi, head of the special education department, highlighted the Kingdom’s keenness to celebrate the occasion with the aim of finding solutions for people with visual disabilities to help them to overcome their problems through international efforts, including through the World Health Organization.
Al-Ghamdi said that Saudi Arabia endeavors to provide comprehensive care services for the visually impaired, and contributes to the employment of services and the development of work programs for the blind in many areas.
“The Kingdom has established many institutes and launched various courses and programs, in addition to preparing schools and universities through a national program that guarantees the right of the blind to science and knowledge, and the development of their abilities to rely on themselves and make them a productive member of society.” He said that the Yanbu education department has implemented many programs aimed at introducing the needs of people with visual disabilities and clarifying how to deal with them.
These programs aim at helping the visually impaired to adapt to their disability, introducing Braille and its importance in educating people with visual disabilities, and providing appropriate family, educational and vocational counseling services for them, in order to help them cater to their psychological needs, face their own problems, and overcome the psychological effects of their disability.
