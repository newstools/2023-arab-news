DUBAI: Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif met with UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan during an official two-day visit to the Gulf state, state news agency (WAM) reported on Thursday. The meeting, which took place at Abu Dhabi’s Al Shati Palace, saw the two leaders discuss “the historical relations between the UAE and Pakistan and ways to enhance joint cooperation and expand its horizons in a way that serves the mutual interests of the two countries across various fields,” said WAM. They exchanged views on regional and international issues of common interest. Sharif praised the UAE’s support for his country, thanking Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed for the aid dispatched last year to help the flood-stricken nation. Both leaders also witnessed the announcement of three agreements between both countries in the fields of diplomatic training, anti-human trafficking efforts, and media. Sharif's visit to the UAE marks his third since becoming premier last April. On Wednesday, Sharif said several countries had pledged $9.7 billion to help Pakistan rebuild following the summer’s catastrophic floods that killed 1,739 people, destroyed more than 2 million homes,  and caused more than $30 billion in damage.
