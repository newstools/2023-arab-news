RIYADH: Saudi Arabia will target a two-hour customs clearance time at all land, sea and air ports through a new initiative by the Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority. The governor of the authority, Suhail Abanmi, said that the scheme comes “after the completion of a phase of continuous cooperation and coordination between the customs clearance system.” He added: “To reach this target is a key possibility for the Kingdom to become a global logistics platform.”   The announcement of the two-hour clearance initiative comes in conjunction with ZATCA’s celebration of World Customs Day, which was marked in Riyadh on Sunday. The initiative aims to improve customs operations, performance and productivity indicators, strengthen the logistics sector and support the Kingdom’s position in the growth of the world economy. Abanmi stressed the authority’s commitment to deepen cooperation with local and international bodies, both public and private, in a way that serves the initiative and contributes to enhancing the efficiency of customs services.   He said that the exchange of knowledge between the authority and its customs counterparts was “a top priority.” Abanmi said: “The authority, through its academy, continuously strives to consolidate the importance of building knowledge and skills, and developing the potential of its employees through specialized programs in all areas of customs work.” He added: “Human capital is the foundation of creativity, innovation and excellence. It is possible to achieve the authority’s strategy, which aims to build an effective working system.” In 2017’s ZATCA’s average clearance period was 12 days.
