RIYADH: Implemented by the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center, the Saudi Project for Landmine Clearance in Yemen dismantled 969 Houthi mines in the fourth week of December. This figure includes 19 anti-personnel mines, 381 anti-tank mines, 555 unexploded ordinances and 14 other explosive devices. The project is one of several initiatives undertaken by Saudi Arabia on the orders of King Salman to help ease the suffering of the Yemeni people. It clears routes for much-needed humanitarian aid aimed at supporting the country’s embattled citizens. The demining took place in Marib, Aden, Jouf, Shabwa, Taiz, Hodeidah, Lahij, Sanaa, Al-Bayda, Al-Dhale and Saada. A total of 379,605 mines have been cleared since the start of the project. More than 1.2 million mines have been planted by the Houthis, claiming the lives of hundreds of civilians. The Saudi project trains local demining engineers and provides them with modern equipment. It also provides support to Yemenis injured by the devices. In June 2022, the project’s contract was extended for another year at a cost of $33.29 million.
