RIYADH: Applications for backing and grants through the Saudi Associations Support Fund were opened on Monday. The announcement was made by Majid Al-Ghanimi, deputy minister of human resources and social development for the social development sector, and chairman of the fund’s board of directors. Through its backing of association programs, the ASF will look to maintain the sustainability of businesses by providing support, concessional or soft loans, and necessary guarantees. It also aims to strengthen staff training, and research and development initiatives. ASF chief executive officer, Fawaz Al-Saadi, said: “The fund carries out many tasks that help it achieve its goals and objectives toward empowering and supporting associations, through developing resources and investments, and activating partnerships to achieve their financial sustainability and maximize their social impact. “The fund seeks to provide supportive and enabling programs that contribute to building a distinguished business model for the associations, and the sustainability of their financial resources to carry out their work independently, in addition to providing financial tools and facilities for the associations that contribute to supporting them and enabling them to achieve their vision and fulfil their mission,” he added. Requests for support and grants can be made via the fund’s electronic portal. It stopped receiving applications through social development centers affiliated with the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development after the ASF’s affiliation was transferred to the National Center for the Development of the Non-Profit Sector.
