ISLAMABAD: A Saudi-Pakistani collaboration led by ILSA Interactive has announced plans to work with various partners in the South Asian country for the next five years, with projects worth $100 million expected to create more than 1,000 jobs. Saudi Arabia’s Prince Fahad bin Mansour, co-founder of the software development company ILSA Interactive, announced the upcoming plans at the closing ceremony of Pakistan’s largest tech conference, Future Fest 2023, on Sunday. Prince Fahad also announced a plan to set up a Saudi-Pakistan Tech House during the three-day expo in Lahore, aimed at promoting “greater ease of doing business” between the two countries. “For the next five years, we are looking forward to creating more than 1,000 jobs in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and globally,” Prince Fahad said. “We are expecting to have more than 300 projects, with a minimum total project value of $100 million.” “We (have) ambitious, strategic plans for our company in which we plan to forge partnerships with IT companies, universities, (and) big enterprises in Pakistan and elsewhere,” he added. ILSA Interactive, which has offices in Riyadh and Lahore, was established in 2009 by Pakistani entrepreneur Salman Nasir. Prince Fahad’s Tech House initiative also plans on establishing headquarters in the Saudi capital, followed by a branch in Pakistan’s second-most populous city. The company seeks “to provide a platform for greater collaboration” between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, Prince Fahad said, as sectors across the Kingdom boost efforts to meet goals outlined under Vision 2030 established by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. “The vision of (the crown prince) opened Saudi Arabia to the world, built and launched platforms for future growth,” he said.
