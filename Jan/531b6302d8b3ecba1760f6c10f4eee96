RIYADH: The Saudi General Directorate of Passports (Jawazat) has launched a digital identification document service for family members of expatriates living in the Kingdom.
The new service is available through the Ministry of Interior’s Absher platform.
In a tweet on Monday, Jawazat said: “The digital document service via the Absher platform allows you to display the digital resident identity of your family members.”
Directorate officials pointed out that digital photos of expat family members could be used anywhere in the country to verify ID, doing away with the need to carry paper identification.
Welcoming the new service, Mohammed Serajudduin, an Indian expatriate working in Riyadh, said: “It will certainly make things easy now there is no need to carry the card. There will no longer be any worries of missing it as it will be available on smartphones, just a click away.”
As part of the recent eighth Absher Forum 2022, Jawazat launched several new e-services for citizens and expats avoiding the necessity for them to visit Jawazat offices in person.
Saudi Public Security also launched an online service to report stolen vehicles during the forum.
The e-service enables citizens and residents to report stolen vehicles online without the need to visit police buildings.
After logging in to the Absher platform, users should select services from the vehicles tab, then select the vehicle to be reported stolen and choose the service for reporting.
