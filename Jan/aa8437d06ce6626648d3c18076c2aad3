RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s Project for the Utilization of Sacrificial Animals, also known as Adahi, recently distributed a significant amount of sacrificial meat to a number of countries.
The distribution included 3,000 sacrificial animals sent each to Azerbaijan, Mali, Mozambique, Chad and Gambia, 4,000 to Niger and 5,000 to Djibouti.
The distribution process involved various humanitarian associations and organizations, under the supervision and follow-up of a committee formed by the respective beneficiary governments.
Representatives of the project from the Islamic Development Bank Group and officials in the respective countries’ governments also participated in the distribution process.
The initiative comes as an extension of the humanitarian relief projects that the Kingdom is implementing in a number of countries under the directives of King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
Last year, Adahi said that 444,554 animals, that were imported from the Horn of Africa, were slaughtered during 2022 Hajj season in accordance with legal and health requirements.
The project was launched in 2000 to utilize Hady and Adahi managed by the Islamic Development Bank.
Adahi distributes Hajj meat to over 30 million people in 27 different countries in Asia and Africa. It can be reached through the following link: www.adahi.org
