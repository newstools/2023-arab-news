RIYADH: Saudi Arabia on Friday strongly condemned and denounced terrorist attacks that targeted civilians in central Somalia, which killed and injured dozens of people earlier this week.
A pair of suicide car bombings in Somalia early Wednesday killed at least 35, including nine members of the same family, in one of the worst attacks by Al-Shabab extremists in retaliation for a government offensive described as “total war.”
Police have said the attackers targeted a military facility in the Mahaas district in the Hiran region, which is at the heart of the government’s offensive against Al-Shabab militants.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs affirmed Saudi Arabia’s stance with “Somalia and its people against all forms of violence and terrorism, reiterating its total rejection of all criminal acts that target innocent people and attempt to undermine security and stability in Somalia.”
The ministry expressed the Kingdom’s sincere condolences and sympathy to the families of the victims and to the government and people of Somalia, and wished the injured a speedy recovery.
The UAE, Bahrain and Egypt also issued similar statements condemning the attacks.(With AP)
