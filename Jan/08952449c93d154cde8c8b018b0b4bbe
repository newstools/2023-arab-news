LONDON: Twitter is being sued for overdue rent on one of its office spaces in San Francisco. The landlord, Columbia Reit-650 California LLC, filed a lawsuit on Thursday accusing the social media company of failing to pay $136,260 in missing rent. The lawsuit relates to the office space at 650 California Street, a different building from the company’s headquarters on Market Street. The landlord said in the lawsuit that it had told Twitter in mid-December to pay the sum or risk breaching the contract. According to The New York Times, Twitter in recent weeks has stopped paying rent on all its global offices to save on costs. Sources also claimed that the tech giant decided to close its Seattle office on Friday, laying off security and cleaning staff, and asking the remaining employees to bring toilet paper from home. Since Elon Musk’s takeover of the company in October for $44 billion, the magnate has sought to cut down costs, claiming that Twitter could go bankrupt if drastic changes are not put in place. In recent weeks, several companies have accused Twitter of withholding payments to contractors or vendors, including accountants and consultants working on key regulatory projects. The company is also being sued for alleged nonpayment of almost $200,000 for private charter flights made the week Musk took over.
