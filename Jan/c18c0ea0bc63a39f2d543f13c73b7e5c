DUBAI: Nadim Cherfan, the founder and choreographer of Lebanese dance troupe Mayyas, is flying high after achieving one of his biggest personal dreams — choreographing for Beyonce at her show-stopping performance at the opening of Atlantis The Royal in Dubai over the weekend. For the latest updates, follow us on Instagram @arabnews.lifestyle "To the artist of my life Beyonce, thank you for making my dream come true. Thank you for being the humblest, most professional and phenomenal human that you are. I could live in this moment forever. I love you, always have and always will. You are my light," he posted on social media, alongside a photo from the Dubai performance.  A post shared by Nadim Cherfan (@nadimcherfan) In a 2019 interview with Arab News, Cherfan was asked about his plans and dreams for the future. “I would love to one day choreograph for Beyonce,” he said at the time. “She’s a huge inspiration and amazing dancer, and she’s the number one entertainer in the world.” It took Cherfan less than four years to turn that dream into a reality, fresh off the troupe's success at last year's "America's Got Talent," winning the talent show and making new fans across the globe. Apart from performing alongside the Mayyas, Beyonce also wore two extravagant costumes designed by talents from the Middle East. She also sampled iconic songs from the Middle East while on stage, including a number by Lebanese icon Fayrouz and “Batwanes Beek” by Algerian superstar Warda.
