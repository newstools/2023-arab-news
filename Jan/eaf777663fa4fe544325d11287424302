BURAIDAH: The Saudi city of dates is holding its annual klaija festival to celebrate the crunchy, sweet delicacy and featuring around 200 local families displaying their products. The 10-day expo in Buraidah, organized by the Qassim Chamber of Commerce and Industry, is the city’s 14th. Last year’s festival recorded sales of SR1 million ($266,369) in its first five days, while the year before about SR7 million was taken in total. With its crunchy texture on the outside and soft filling consisting of molasses, dates and cinnamon, klaija have long been one of Saudi Arabia’s favorite sweets. The dessert is usually made and served in winter with Saudi coffee. It is believed to have made its way through Iraq around 500 years ago before becoming an integral part of the Saudi culture and cuisine. Companies and institutions in the dessert industry will also be participating at the festival.
