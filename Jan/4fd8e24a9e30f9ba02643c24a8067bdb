DUBAI: The resignation of Kuwait's government was accepted on Thursday in an Emiri decree, state news agency KUNA reported. Kuwaiti Prime Minister Sheikh Ahmad Nawaf Al-Sabah on Monday submitted the resignation of his cabinet to Crown Prince Sheikh Meshal Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah. Minister of State for Cabinet Affairs Barrak Al-Shaitan said the resignation was due to a deadlock reached on various issues with the legislative authority during the first session of the National Assembly’s 17th legislative term. The minister expressed confidence the crown prince would take necessary action that served the best interests of the country. The resignation comes less than four months after the government was sworn in.
