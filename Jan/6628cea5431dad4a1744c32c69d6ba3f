LONDON: Netflix released on Wednesday the trailer for “The Exchange,” the new Kuwaiti series that focuses on the challenges faced by women in the male-dominated stock market of the 1980s. The drama based on true events is set in Kuwait in 1988, depicting two women who break into the booming stock exchange on the eve of Saddam Hussein’s invasion of the country. “I grew up in Kuwait, surrounded by empowered women who were pioneering industries, especially in finance,” explains Nadia Ahmad, one of the writers of the series. “They demanded to be heard and succeeded, breaking into the workforce and blazing new trails for future generations. “‘The Exchange’ is my love letter to them, bringing an amalgamation of them to life in Farida and Munira in a new and exciting way,” she added. The series was conceived and written by Ahmad, with Anne and Adam Sobel, and is set to premiere in February 2023. It is directed by Egyptian director Karim Elshenawy and Kuwaiti filmmaker Jasem Al-Muhanna, and produced by Abdullah Boushahri. The cast includes Kuwaiti-Iraqi actress Rawan Mahdi, Egyptian actress Mona Hussain, and actor and “The Ten Sins’” writer Hussain Al-Mahdi. “Having grown up in Kuwait and being surrounded by independent women my whole life, this production is one that is close to my heart,” said Boushahri. “Besides the plot, I am excited for the audience to see how we brought this era to life, that brings together local and international expertise in a high production masterpiece, shot and produced entirely in Kuwait.” “The Exchange” is one of Netflix’s first productions in Kuwait and follows the success of “The Cage,” the eight-episode comedy-drama series launched by the streaming giant in September 2022.
