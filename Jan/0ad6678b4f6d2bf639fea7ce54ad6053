LONDON: Pope Francis has called for the preservation of the historical and legal status quo in occupied Jerusalem, the Palestinian News and Information Agency has reported. During his annual meeting with the diplomatic corps accredited to Vatican City on Monday, Pope Francis expressed concern about the rise in violence in Jerusalem. He said that Jerusalem belongs to the three monotheistic religions — Islam, Judaism and Christianity — and noted that it should be a forum for peace rather than a theater of conflict. He hoped that the Palestinian and Israeli sides would resume direct talks to realize the two-state vision, in line with international law and relevant UN resolutions. Palestine’s Ambassador to the Holy See, Issa Kassissieh, conveyed President Mahmoud Abbas’ greetings to the pope during the meeting, and urged him to continue praying for justice and peace in Jerusalem, as well as the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination.
