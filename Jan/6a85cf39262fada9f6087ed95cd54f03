RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s Water Regulator has updated the water and wastewater services guide and launched an awareness campaign targeting all stakeholders. The latest version of the guide seeks to serve as a reference for all stakeholders including service providers and beneficiaries. It includes rules, rights, and duties that define the relationship between service providers and consumers. The awareness drive titled “Your Guide” aims to educate all stakeholders about their respective roles, rights, and duties. The guide is available on the official portal www.wr.gov.sa or can be accessed via its social media accounts @Water Regulator. The Water Regulator is an official government body tasked to regulate service providers of the water sector, based on the provisions of the water law, except for cogeneration services.
