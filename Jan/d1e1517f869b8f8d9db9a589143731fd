RIYADH: The National Waste Management Center on Wednesday launched its second awareness campaign nationwide. Held under the slogan “Reduce-Repeat-Recycle,” it was launched simultaneously in Riyadh, Makkah, Jeddah, Taif, Madinah, Jazan, Abha and Baha. The first campaign was held on Dec. 29, 2022, for three days in Riyadh, Najran, Eastern Province, Qassim, Northern Borders, Hail, Tabuk and Jouf. The program includes interactive educational stalls in each city to provide information on ways to save energy, reduce waste, and use of effective recycling methods, said Sultan Al-Harthi, general manager of the center.  The center is a Saudi government entity established in April 2019 for the management of all types of waste including from construction, demolitions, agriculture, medical facilities and sewage systems. It also oversees the removal of hazardous industrial, radioactive and nuclear waste.
