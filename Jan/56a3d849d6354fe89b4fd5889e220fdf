RIYADH: Saudi Aramco highlighted its experience with sustainable development during the second edition of the Real Estate Future Forum in Riyadh, the Saudi Press Agency reported. Nabeel Al-Jama, executive vice president of human resources and corporate services at Saudi Aramco, reviewed Ajyal, which is the company’s mega project to build homes for employees. It is the first infrastructure in the Middle East to receive an Envision Award for sustainable facilities. Al-Jama said the project includes an integrated infrastructure, meets international specifications, and incorporates technologies to reduce water consumption. He added: “The project is notable for its alignment with the Quality of Life Program, which is one of the Kingdom’s ambitious Vision 2030 programs, as the Ajyal residential neighborhoods contain many green spaces.” Al-Jama also spotlighted the King Salman Energy Park project as another successful model, in which the company adhered to all environmental, social, and corporate governance standards. The fully integrated industrial ecosystem has drawn more than 40 major energy and technology companies, with total direct investment in the Eastern Province project expected to exceed $3 billion in the coming years.
