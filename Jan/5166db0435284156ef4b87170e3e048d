BERLIN: European Union foreign ministers are expected to agree further sanctions targeting members of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps at their meeting in Brussels on Monday, a spokesperson for the German Foreign Office said on Friday.Asked at a regular government news conference in Berlin whether sanctions could hamper diplomatic efforts to prevent Tehran from developing nuclear weapons, the spokesperson said: “The focus of our policy currently is increasing pressure on the Iranian regime.”
