LONDON: A decision by the Harvard Kennedy School to deny a fellowship to the former head of Human Rights Watch over his criticism of Israel has been slammed by leading figures and organizations, The Observer reported on Sunday. Kenneth Roth formerly led HRW, which has accused Israel of promoting apartheid policies in occupied Palestine. He was offered a senior fellowship at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Carr Center for Human Rights Policy, but the move — after Roth’s 29 years at HRW — is said to have been blocked by Douglas Elmendorf, the school’s dean. The decision is a reflection of “how utterly afraid the Kennedy School has become of any criticism of Israel,” Roth told The Observer, adding that the institution is under growing pressure from donors and supporters to conform to a pro-Israel view. Civil rights groups have condemned the school, which boasts alumni including 17 heads of state. “If Harvard’s decision was based on HRW’s advocacy under Ken’s leadership, this is profoundly troubling — from both a human rights and an academic freedom standpoint,” said Anthony Romero, director of the American Civil Liberties Union. “Scholars and fellows have to be judged on their merits, not whether they please powerful political interests.” Free expression NGO PEN America said in a statement: “It is the role of a human rights defender to call out governments harshly, to take positions that are unpopular in certain quarters and to antagonize those who hold power and authority. “There is no suggestion that Roth’s criticisms of Israel are in any way based on racial or religious animus. “Withholding Roth’s participation in a human rights program due to his own staunch critiques of human rights abuses by governments worldwide raises serious questions about the credibility of the Harvard program itself.”
