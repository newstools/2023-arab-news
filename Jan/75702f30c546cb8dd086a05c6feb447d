Alsulaiman Group has acquired the exclusive franchise rights for Circle K convenience stores in Saudi Arabia. The investment will support the growth of the Circle K brand in the Kingdom. Circle K offers a wide range of fast and friendly services, including fresh food, hot and cold beverages and other convenience products, as well as fuel, car wash, and in a growing number of locations, electric vehicle charging. Established in 1951 in El Paso, Texas, US, Circle K is part of Alimentation Couche-Tard, a global leader in convenience and mobility headquartered in Laval, Canada. With Circle K as its global brand, Couche-Tard’s network today consists of more than 14,300 locations across 24 countries and territories, including approximately 1,900 franchise locations in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Oceania. ASG manages an ecosystem of businesses across three different sectors, including omni-channel retail, logistic services and retail real estate. These businesses include IKEA Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, Flow Progressive Logistics, Ehteraf Real Estate Development, a joint venture with Livspace, along with strategic investments in e-commerce fulfillment service Salasa, and Cartlow, a reverse logistics and recommerce platform. Saud Alsulaiman, CEO of ASG, said: “Under Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia is experiencing accelerated population growth and internal migration toward concentrated metropolitan areas. Therefore, there is a growing opportunity for quality convenience stores to operate in areas with high traffic, such as office towers, gas stations, airports and train stations.” In addition to increasing its presence in metropolitan centers, ASG plans to pilot a sub-franchising model to enable entrepreneurs to take advantage of the Circle K platform to launch their businesses and expand the brand’s services to the wider population across the Kingdom.
