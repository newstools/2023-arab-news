RIYADH: A spectacular stage production of French writer Antoine de Saint-Exupery’s fantasy tale “The Little Prince” has opened in Riyadh. Part of the Riyadh Season of activities, the music and dance show will run daily from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. until Jan. 14 at the World Theater in Boulevard Riyadh City. Based on the novel of the same name, “The Little Prince” was written by the French aristocrat and military airman in 1943 and tells the story of a pilot landing in the desert, where he meets the titular prince and joins him on an extraordinary journey. Show narrator, Chris Mouron, told Arab News: “Antoine wrote this book during the peak of World War II, a very difficult time for humanity. “We created this adaptation to give the book justice and translate those feelings of love, loss, and courage to the people watching ‘The Little Prince’ show.” Director Anne Tournie said: “It took us three years to perfect the show with our 12 performers. First, we did visuals and light, then music, and choreography. “While I am better with visuals, Mouron is best with storytelling. We want people watching it to really feel the impact of body language as we use it to interpret the feelings of the characters,” she added. The production sees the young prince embark on several adventures during which he explores different emotions through interactions with various characters. Dylan Barone, 26, who plays the little prince, told Arab News: “You really need to get into the character and live the moments you’re going through with all the characters that the little prince meets. And so that’s what makes it all really beautiful. “I knew I needed to find my inner child to really be harnessed on stage. It was a great opportunity because I got to train for acrobatics, aerial performance, choreography, and acting all at once.”
