DUBAI: American socialite, reality TV star and businesswoman Kim Kardashian has purchased Princess Diana’s Attallah Cross pendant for nearly $200,000, auction house Sotheby’s announced. For the latest updates, follow us on Instagram @arabnews.lifestyle The Attallah Cross, a 1920s pendant designed by luxury jewellery designer Garrard and owned by the former group chief executive of Asprey & Garrard, the late British Palestinian businessman Naim Attallah CBE, sold for $201,998 in the Sotheby’s royal and noble sale on Wednesday.   The cross was first bought from Garrard by Attallah in the 1980s and through his friendship with Diana Attallah was able to loan it to her on several occasions over a number of years. The pendant, which was most famously worn by Diana at a London charity gala in October 1987, sold for more than double its pre-auction estimate.   The cross-shaped pendant – thought to be a one-off private commission by Garrard – is a bold and colourful piece set with square-cut amethysts and accented by circular-cut diamonds. The cross has a total diamond weight of approximately 5.25 carats. “Princess Diana and my father were friends and I remember that she often came to see him at the historic Garrard store on Regent Street, where his office was, and she would ask to borrow the pendant on several occasions – she really loved the piece” said Ramsay Attallah, current owner of the cross.
