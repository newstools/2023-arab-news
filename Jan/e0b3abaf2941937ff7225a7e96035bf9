RIYADH: Saudi Arabia strongly condemned and denounced on Tuesday the tearing apart of a copy of the Qur’an in The Hague, the seat of the Netherlands government, on Sunday during a protest. A foreign ministry statement said the act was a “provocative step” that hurt the feelings of millions of Muslims across the globe. The statement affirmed the Kingdom’s position that calls for the spread of dialogue, tolerance and coexistence, and that rejects the causes of hatred and extremism. The act comes after Swedish-Danish politician Rasmus Paludan set fire to a copy of Islam’s holy book in front of Turkey’s embassy in the Swedish capital Stockholm on Saturday.
