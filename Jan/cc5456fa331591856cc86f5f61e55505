RIYADH: The rich history of Uqair, one of Saudi Arabia’s first and oldest seaports located 100 km south of Dammam on the Kingdom’s east coast, has been showcased in a major festival this year. The Noqush Festival, which kicked off on Jan. 12, will conclude on Tuesday, and highlights the diplomatic and economic significance of the port over the years, including the history of its customs and passports offices, mosque and various other buildings. Uqair was the initial gateway for the transport of goods into the Kingdom at the nation’s inception. In addition, King Abdulaziz would host meetings with other nations’ leaders and diplomats. The festival has featured various live cultural and heritage programs, a camel caravan show, photographic exhibition and marine handicrafts. Dr. Jasir Al-Herbish, CEO of the Saudi Heritage Commission, told Arab News that the organization’s goal is to preserve the nation’s “heritage assets by holding appropriate events and festivals.” The Heritage Commission organized several events across the country last year, including the Al-Ahsa Oasis Festival, in cooperation with the region’s municipality, which featured folk music and other shows. Al-Ahsa also featured various stories about how the people of the region pledged their allegiance to the founder of the third Saudi state King Abdulaziz. Also highlighted was the story of Ain Najm, the site of a spring, which was a stopping place for Hajj pilgrims and businesspeople; and Amiriya School, one of the first schools established in the Kingdom.
