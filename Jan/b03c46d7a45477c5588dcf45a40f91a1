CHICAGO: Police in Cleveland, Ohio released a statement Sunday saying they are actively investigating the Jan. 27 reported disappearance of a visiting Saudi citizen, Omar Al-Anazi. Al-Anazi, 30, was last seen around 10 a.m. by friends after spending time in the city’s tourist area along the Lake Erie waterfront. According to witnesses, he was socializing with friends in the downtown area when he was reported missing, the Cleveland Division of Police officials said. “He went with a group to the East 9th Street Pier at approximately 2:30 a.m. to look at the water and was reportedly intoxicated,” officials of the Cleveland Division of Police Department said in a statement. When the group went to leave, the statement added, “Al-Anazi reportedly walked away.” Cleveland Police said that Al-Anazi’s friends searched for him but were unable to locate him. The police have categorized the disappearance as “endangered” because of his circumstances as a visitor to the city with limited English language skills. Al-Anazi, police said, is visiting from Saudi Arabia and reportedly does not speak English. He was last seen wearing a beige jacket and pants. Cleveland Police are asking anyone with information to contact them immediately by calling 1-216-621-1234.
