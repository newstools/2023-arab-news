So far we’ve got nothing but warmth and love, and we want to give that back and show our appreciation. “We’ve changed our philosophy around that and we’ve come to places like Dubai, and you want to drink up the culture and drink up the place, and that’s why we want to stay here a bit longer and fill up our boots,” the actor said.
