Barcelona coach Xavi will be able to count on Robert Lewandowski again after the striker missed the league game against Atletico while serving the first of a three-game suspension.

The results left the Seville club in fourth place in the Spanish league and with a spot secured in the round of 16 of the Copa del Rey. “It was important to win going into the Super Cup,” Betis coach Manuel Pellegrini said. “We will go with a lot of confidence.” The team coached by Gennaro Gattuso and led by veteran forward Edinson Cavani arrive in Saudi Arabia having won only one of their last eight league games. “We are going through a tough moment and I’m the first responsible for it because I’m the coach,” Gattuso said. “We have to keep working hard, it’s the only solution.”
