CAIRO: Egypt has condemned the attack that claimed the lives of seven Israelis in a shooting incident that targeted worshippers at a synagogue in East Jerusalem. The country expressed its total rejection and strong condemnation of Fridayâ€™s attack in a statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and was critical of all operations that target civilians. The country offered its sincere condolences to the families of the victims, and wished a speedy recovery for the injured. It also warned of the dangers of the ongoing escalation between the Palestinian and Israeli sides. Egypt called on both sides to exercise maximum restraint and to cease attacks and provocative actions to avoid slipping into a vicious cycle of violence that would worsen the political and humanitarian situation and undermine efforts and all chances of reviving the peace process. These developments followed an Israeli army attack on the West Bank which left 10 Palestinians dead.
