Feathers, sequins, fringes, ruffles, hooded dresses and geometric patterns were all seen on the runway. His feminine suits featured cut-out detailing to add an elevated touch to his designs.   Headgear seems to be making a comeback this season. Zuhair’s new collections features oversized hats, satin scarves and beaded headpieces.

Made from the same fabric and patterns as the dresses, the asymmetric, geometric and structured hats will make a statement on red carpets.
