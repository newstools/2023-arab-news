RIYADH: The King Abdulaziz and His Companions Foundation for Giftedness and Creativity, known as Mawhiba, has issued a report on the awards won by Saudi students at the international and regional Olympics in 2022 and the Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair. Saudi Arabia won 94 international scientific awards, including 72 medals at competitions and Olympics and 22 international awards during the national team’s participation at ISEF 2022, the Saudi Press Agency reported on Sunday. The report described the Olympics and international and regional awards as high-level annual global competitions and among the top contests for students particularly in the areas of mathematics, physics, chemistry, information and communications technology, biology, and science. It noted that most of the competitions — many of which had been running for more than 50 years — were held during the summer holiday and involved participants from at least 100 countries. In 2020, the Kingdom was represented in 13 events, winning 57 awards and medals, while in 2021 it took part in 14, scooping 56 accolades. Last year, the number of participations was 18, resulting in 72 awards, including eight gold medals, 22 silver, and 25 bronze. The report highlighted the participation of a Saudi team in ISEF 2022, held in Atlanta, Georgia, that achieved 22 global awards with backing from Mawhiba, and the Ministry of Education.
