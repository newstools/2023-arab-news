BEIRUT: Lebanon’s central bank froze all bank accounts belonging to Lebanese currency exchange house CTEX and its owner Hassan Moukaled on Thursday, days after the US Treasury sanctioned them over alleged financial ties to blacklisted group Hezbollah.
The central bank said in a statement that it also froze the accounts of two of Moukaled’s family members.
Meanwhile, Moukalled denied that he or his company CTEX have financial ties to Hezbollah and said he would mount legal challenges to US Treasury sanctions against him and the company.
He also told Reuters that the basis for the sanctions included false information.
