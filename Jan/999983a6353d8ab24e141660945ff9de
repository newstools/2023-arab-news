MADRID: Kuwait’s foreign policy was targeted at building bridges of understanding and promoting peace and stability in the Middle East and beyond, the Kuwaiti ambassador to Spain said.
Khalifa Al-Kharafi was speaking to the Kuwait News Agency on the sidelines of an annual reception hosted on Wednesday by Spain’s King Felipe VI for the diplomatic corps in Madrid.
The envoy said: “The humanitarian dimension and support to international peace efforts are among the basic features of Kuwait’s balanced foreign policy.”
Dealing with the crisis caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Al-Kharafi pointed out that Kuwait had repeatedly called for a peaceful solution based on a commitment to international law and the UN Charter, and respect for the sovereignty of states.
“Kuwait dispatched relief aid for the Ukrainian people to alleviate their suffering from the conflict,” he added.
On relations with Spain, the ambassador said they were strengthening in all areas and the embassy in Madrid was always working to deepen mutually beneficial cooperation.
In his address, King Felipe VI highlighted Spain’s support for Ukraine and the need for allies to stand united in the face of “Russian aggression.”
The monarch noted that from the start of the conflict, Spain had backed Ukraine on bilateral and multilateral levels through the provision of military and humanitarian assistance in a bid to counter “the indiscriminate Russian attacks on the civilian infrastructure in Ukraine.”
He added that the response of Spain, the EU, and the international community was crucial in repelling “the Russian onslaught,” and reiterated his country’s condemnation of Moscow’s attack on Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.
The reception, hosted at Madrid’s Royal Palace, was attended by ambassadors, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and Foreign Affairs Minister Jose Manuel Albares Bueno, and other dignitaries.
