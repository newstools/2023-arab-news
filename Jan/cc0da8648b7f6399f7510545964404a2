DUBAI: A UAE plane carrying the second batch of household electricity generators arrived in Warsaw, Poland, on Friday as part of aid for Ukrainian civilians battling winter amid the war. The aid aims to provide warmth in Ukrainian homes after Russian strikes have targeted energy infrastructure across the country, causing power outages and posing an additional challenge for civilians battling harsh winter conditions. The UAE announced earlier in December that it was sending a shipment of 2,500 household generators to Ukraine. While the first batch of 1,200 generators was sent last month, the rest were delivered on Friday, according to Emirates News Agency (WAM). The support comes as part of the $100 million humanitarian aid pledged by the UAE to Ukraine. In response to the United Nations Ukraine Flash Appeal and the Ukraine Situation Regional Refugee Response, the UAE has dispatched eight planes carrying 360 tonnes of food supplies, medical aid and ambulances for Ukrainian refugees in Poland, Moldova and Bulgaria since the onset of the war.
