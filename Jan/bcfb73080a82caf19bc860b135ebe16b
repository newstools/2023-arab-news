RIYADH: The economic value of volunteer work in Saudi Arabia increased significantly in 2022, with the total economic return amounting to more than SR923 million ($246 million) in 2022, the latest government data showed. According to the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development, the monetary value of the volunteer hour totaled more than SR64 per head last year. The government’s new National Volunteer Portal, run by the MHRSD, is a platform that set a target to attract 1 million volunteers as part of the broader ambitions of Saudi Vision 2030. It promotes a range of work opportunities, including helping with National Day activities and initiatives, offered by a variety of organizations. The portal offers a platform to match the two groups and ensure both are suitably protected. In 2022, the Kingdom surpassed the intended goals set by the MHRSD. The data showed that the number of one-time volunteers increased to more than 658,000 male and female volunteers, while the repeat volunteers were more than 5.4 million. The government data revealed that more than 65 million people have already benefited from the scheme, which last year saw volunteers donating a combined 40 million hours of their time. In addition, 81 training workshops took place in Saudi Arabia, and over 373,000 volunteer opportunities were offered in over 20 different fields. MHRSD confirmed that the aggregate number of individuals registered on its national platform for volunteer work surpassed 1.2 million people last year. It added that more than 5,200 public and private sector organizations have already registered to provide volunteer opportunities in the Kingdom. In regards to voluntary jobs, they varied between general volunteering, which accounted for 44.5 percent of the total, skilled volunteering which accounted for 35 percent, and professional volunteering at 20.5 percent in 2022. Saudi Arabia’s volunteers recorded a 98.05 satisfaction rate with regard to their volunteer experiences last year, the government data showed. Minister of Human Resources and Social Development Ahmed Al-Rajhi tweeted: “The qualitative achievements fulfilled in #VolunteerWork 2022; An incentive for giving more in 2023. Thanks to all the volunteers for their national efforts.”
