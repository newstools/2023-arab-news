BEIRUT: A building collapsed in a neighborhood in Syria’s northern city of Aleppo early Sunday, killing at least 16 people, including one child, with several still missing, Syrian state media reported.
The five-story building housing about 30 people in the Sheikh Maksoud neighborhood under the control of the US-backed Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces collapsed overnight, according to the report. Water leakages had weakened the structure’s foundation, it said.
