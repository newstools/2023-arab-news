CAIRO: A joint security operation between Morocco and Spain has led to dismantling a cell affiliated with the Daesh militant group, the Moroccan news agency reported Wednesday. The cell consisted of three members operating in both countries. The central office for judicial investigations in Morocco said in a statement that interventions by national security forces led to the arrest of one extremist member of the cell. Simultaneously, the Spanish authorities also arrested two other members who were active within the same terrorist cell in Almeria. The judicial office said investigations showed that those arrested had pledged allegiance to the Daesh group and were active in spreading and promoting extremist ideology for the purpose of recruitment. The arrested individuals also expressed their willingness to engage in terrorist operations after they were unable to join the strongholds of this terrorist organization in the Sahel region, as they have relations with fighters charged with recruiting and facilitating the entry of militants, the statement continued.
