LONDON: UK hate preacher Anjem Choudary has urged extremists to stage attacks on British soldiers in the wake of Prince Harry’s comments about killing Taliban fighters, The Metro reported. Choudary, who was convicted on terrorism charges in 2016 and has been accused of inciting a series of attacks, was featured in the Arab News series “Preachers of Hate.” Prince Harry, in his newly released memoir “Spare,” revealed that he had killed 25 Taliban fighters while serving as a helicopter pilot in Afghanistan, describing them as “chess pieces.” In response, Choudary, 55, urged extremists to target British forces in Syria, Iraq and North Africa. “The world now knows of the wickedness that the US, UK and others engaged in, including repeatedly murdering innocent unarmed Muslims,” he said. “Nevertheless, Harry still saw fit to plunge his knife further into the hearts of Muslims with his callous boastful comments.” Former Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan-Smith described Choudhary’s comments as a “direct and indirect threat to our constitutional head of state, our monarchy, and for that matter our government and all public servants.” Duncan-Smith urged authorities to “move on this man.” Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood said: “I would encourage Prince Harry to follow up with a statement of humility to clarify it was unwise to make such comments and out of step to what the rest of the Armed Forces do. “I believe he needs to recognize it was ill-construed and will be interpreted the wrong way to ratchet up hate. Otherwise there will be others in addition to Choudary who will try to stir up hatred.”
