RIYADH: The Saudi Media Forum is scheduled to take place on Feb. 20-21 in Riyadh under the theme “Media in a Changing World.” The forum emphasizes the importance of media and communication and encourages cultural and civil dialogue based on positivity and openness. It aims to be a periodic event that brings together media and cultural leaders, intellectuals and professionals to a single platform to exchange knowledge and engage in discussions relevant to the sector. Media is a form of soft power that affects change at home and abroad. Whenever media influences for good, it is a reflection of the wider community’s capacity for healthy interaction. Saudi Arabia today represents an important center for developments in media. Through 400 media companies, 25 local television channels, 80 media production houses and 20 specialized local radio stations, Riyadh is considered an influencer in the Middle East and is the region’s largest media and advertising market. In conjunction with the forum, the Saudi Media Forum Award recognizes prominent media personalities who served Saudi and Arab media. The award aims to develop media in the Kingdom, stimulate competition and honor creatives. Individuals can nominate themselves for the award, and Saudi media organizations are also entitled to nominate any of their affiliates, with the exception of the person of the year, who is chosen by the award’s board of directors.
