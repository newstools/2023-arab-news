LONDON: A 37-year-old German mother accused of keeping a young Yazidi woman as a slave after traveling to Iraq to join Daesh will face trial on Wednesday, Sky News reported. The woman, who cannot be named under German law, allegedly belonged to the extremist group for over four years. She is charged with crimes against humanity, and aiding and abetting genocide. Prosecutors claim she left Germany with her husband in December 2014 and lived in various locations in Syria before relocating to Mosul in Iraq. Following their arrival in Mosul, the couple allegedly occupied a house whose owners  had been driven out by Daesh, Sky News said. In April 2016, the woman’s husband allegedly enslaved a 22-year-old Yazidi woman previously captured by extremist fighters during a raid on her home village in 2014. She was allegedly made available to various fighters to do housework and for sex. The husband allegedly frequently raped and beat the Yazidi woman with the knowledge of the accused, it is claimed. The accused woman helped ensure her slave could not escape by taking her black clothing, without which she could not leave the house in Daesh territory. On March 8, 2019, the couple, their two daughters and the Yazidi woman were captured by Kurdish forces while fleeing the final Daesh stronghold of Baghuz in Syria. During this escape attempt the accused’s husband allegedly told the Yazidi woman that she was now “free.” The accused was arrested after while re-entering Germany on March 31, 2022, and has been held in pre-trial detention since. The trial is expected to last several weeks.
