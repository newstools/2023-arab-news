LONDON: Two-thirds of Albanian migrants in the UK with mandated electronic tags have disabled the devices to evade authorities, The Telegraph reported. Of the 284 migrants who were handed electronic tags since June last year, 204 were Albanian, Home Office data shows, and 65 percent of these were subsequently categorized as “noncompliant” after they violated tagging conditions, including disabling or removing the devices. Sources told The Telegraph that many of the Albanian migrants were unconcerned with breaching tag rules because they traveled to the UK for economic opportunity rather than to claim asylum. Many Albanians have subsequently entered the black economy and drug trade, including several who posted guides on social media showing other migrants how to disable the electronic ankle tags. This comes amid a record surge in Albanians crossing the English Channel. In 2022, 46,000 migrants who crossed into Britain were Albanian, up from 800 the previous year. An Albanian source told The Telegraph: “They don’t care if they are tagged. In order to avoid deportation, they go underground and remove the tags.” A UK probation spokesperson said: “Those who tamper with tags are reported instantly thanks to sophisticated safety measures and face going back to court or prison if they do.”
