CHICAGO: The body of missing Saudi Arabian tourist Abdulrahman Al-Anazi was discovered early on Monday in Lake Erie in Cleveland, Ohio. Al-Anazi was reported missing afte having a meal with friends and a relative on Friday morning, Jan. 27. They said Al-Anazi had walked away and was not seen again. Cleveland Police officials said they sent search teams to find the man, near to where he was last seen in the popular tourist district near the East 9th Street pier along the lakefront. Al-Anazi’s family immediately contacted the authorities in Clevland and the Saudi embassy in the US to investigate his disappearance. “He left without his jacket, without his mobile phone and wallet, on the condition that he would return after that,” his brother Badr Falah Al-Anazi told MBC News 24. “Meanwhile, his cousin was waiting for him in the car, provided that he would after 10 minutes,” he added. His body was found in the waters of Lake Erie early on Monday, near to where he had last been seen, it was reported. The National Weather Service reported that temperatures at the location were only 2 C. The official cause of death will not be announced until he is examined by the Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner. Cleveland police told Arab News they were concerned about Alanazi's whereabouts. He reportedly could not speak English, was unfamiliar with the area and that his disappearance status was listed by the police as “endangered.” Relatives told local news media that Alanazi had been in the US for the treatment of an unknown medical condition. Al-Anazi’s passing comes after the death of 25-year-old Saudi student Alwaleed Algheraibi who was found stabbed to death in his Hansberry Street property in Germantown Philadelphia on Jan. 23. A Pennsylvania judge has denied bail for Nicole Marie Rodgers, 19, who is accused of the Jan. 23 murder.
