Voeller’s job would be to “lay the foundations for a successful home European Championship in 2024,” which will be hosted in Germany, he said in a statement.
The four-time winners crashed out in the group stages of the World Cup for the second time in a row, leading team director Oliver Bierhoff to step aside in December.
Voeller will take over the role for the senior men’s team on February 1.
The former International’s appointment came at the suggestion of a task force established by the DFB in December, which included Voeller himself.
“With Rudi Voeller, we have found the ideal person for the next 20 months,” DFB president Bernd Neuendorf said in a statement.
A prolific goalscorer in his playing days, and later coach, Voeller enjoys a cult-like status in Germany.
The striker scored 47 goals in 90 games for West Germany and Germany, eight of which came at World Cup level.
Voeller lifted the World Cup with Germany in 1990, winning a late penalty as his side triumphed 1-0 over Argentina.
He went on to coach the national side, taking them to the 2002 World Cup final, losing 2-0 to Brazil.
Voeller also worked as a sporting director, helping establish Bayer Leverkusen as one of the country’s biggest clubs during two stints with the side. For the latest updates, follow us on Twitter @ArabNewsSport
