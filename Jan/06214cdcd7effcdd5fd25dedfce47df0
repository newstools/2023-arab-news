LONDON: CNN Arabic Business has launched as a digital business platform and is officially live from Sunday. The media company said its free new channel will deliver global and regional economic, business and finance news and analysis for Arabic speakers around the globe. “CNN Business Arabic is a new, complementary offering to both CNN’s business output and our engagement with Arabic speakers worldwide through our existing CNN Arabic platform,” said Phil Nelson, a CNN Chief Operating Officer. The plans for CNN Business Arabic were released in June of last year when International Media Investments and CNN International Commercial announced a joint partnership to bring “a website from the Mena region for Arabic speakers all over the world.” Nelson said he wished IMI “every success in this venture, and look forward to working with the team to bring a fresh approach to how Arabic audiences can access business news and information across a range of digital platforms.” The new channel will cover a wide range of topics, including sustainability, green investment, cryptocurrency, property, energy and technology. CNN said it would offer daily, weekly and monthly shows to engage audiences, along with insightful podcasts, and exclusive interviews with both Arab and non-Arabic-speaking business leaders and influencers. The channel is led by Editor-in-Chief Maher Chmaytelli, who has more than 25 years’ experience working in the Middle East and North Africa for Thomson Reuters and Bloomberg. “This is an incredibly exciting moment for us, and we are dedicated to providing high quality content that inspires and empowers Arabic speakers around the world, making CNN Business Arabic the go-to business news platform,” Chmaytelli said.
