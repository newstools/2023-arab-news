AMMAN: The Jordanian Armed Forces said on Wednesday that they are working with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to follow up on the discovery in Jerusalem of what might be the remains of 15 Jordanian soldiers. It is believed they were killed in the town of Beit Hanina in northern East Jerusalem during the June 1967 war, the Jordan News Agency reported. A JAF source said a military task force was sent on Wednesday to investigate and examine the remains but additional laboratory tests will be required to determine the identities of the individuals.
