RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s Cabinet condemned and rejected on Tuesday the repeated burning of copies of the Qur’an in a number of European countries recently. The Cabinet said it was important that the governments of those countries addressed practices that hurt the feelings of millions of Muslims around the world. The recent desecration of Islam’s holy book by far-right activists in Sweden and the Netherlands has sparked protests among Muslims around the world. Earlier this month, Danish anti-Islam activist Rasmus Paludan received permission from police to stage a protest outside the Turkish Embassy in Stockholm, where on Jan. 21 he burned the Qur’an. Days later, Edwin Wagensveld, Dutch leader of the far-right Pegida movement in the Netherlands, tore pages out of a copy of the Qur’an near the Dutch Parliament and stomped on them. Paludan then burned a copy of the holy book outside a mosque in Copenhagen on Jan. 27.
