MILAN: Inter Milanâ€™s Italian Super Cup celebration was ruined with a 1-0 home loss to Empoli in Serie A on Monday. Milan Skriniar was sent off with two yellow cards in the first half to leave Inter with 10 men, and 19-year-old Tommaso Baldanzi scored for Empoli midway through the second half following a poor effort from Inter goalkeeper Andre Onana. Before kickoff, Inter presented the Super Cup trophy to their fans following their 3-0 win over city rivals AC Milan in Saudi Arabia last week. Inter remained third, one point behind Milan, who visit Lazio on Tuesday. Empoli, who extended their unbeaten run to five matches, moved ahead of Juventus into ninth. Also, Bologna were held 1-1 at home by last-place Cremonese.For the latest updates, follow us on Twitter @ArabNewsSport For the latest updates, follow us on Twitter @ArabNewsSport
