CAIRO: As issues concerning climate change gain greater attention, Bahrain is set to host over 300 decision-makers discussing net-zero goals during the Sustainability Forum Middle East taking place on Jan. 12. Being held under the patronage of Bahrain’s Minister of Oil and Environment, Mohamed bin Daina, the forum will debate climate change issues under the theme “Business Transition to Net-Zero — the Path Towards a Successful Low-Carbon Future.”   In a series of panel discussions, the forum will kick off with a keynote address from Mark Thomas, group chief executive at Oil and Gas Holding Company, and workshops by senior representatives from KPMG, Bahrain Institute for Banking and Finance, Deloitte Middle East, and EY-Parthenon. “The Kingdom of Bahrain is keen to enrich the understanding of all sectors related to energy, environment, and climate change, building on sustainable development achievements and doubling efforts in the coming years,” bin Daina said in a statement. The forum will discuss topics from Egypt’s COP27 event and the road ahead for COP28 which is set to be held in the UAE in November 2023. “Organizing such a forum reflects the private sector’s belief in the pivotal role of the environment in achieving sustainable development,” bin Daina added. Moreover, the event will set net-zero ambitions for the Middle East and North Africa region with regard to financing and the evolution of climate regulations.
