PARIS: Parisians will be invited to vote on whether to allow electric scooter rental services to continue operating in the city as authorities weigh banning the controversial for-hire vehicles, the capital’s mayor has said. The issue is “extremely divisive,” Mayor Anne Hidalgo told the weekend edition of Le Parisien newspaper, with critics saying riders show only cursory respect for the rules of the road. They often defy bans on riding on pavements, or park without consideration, while some abandon the scooters in parks or even toss them into the Seine River. Fans meanwhile praise the zippy fleets — totaling 15,000 scooters operated by companies Lime, Dott and Tier — as a fast alternative to cars or crowded public transport. The mayor said she herself was leaning toward a ban.
