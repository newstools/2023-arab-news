RIYADH: The Saudi Design Festival is “tailor-made” to promote sustainable growth in the industry, the event’s director and co-founder, and CEO of consultancy firm &bouqu, told Arab News. Basma Bouzo said: “We started Saudi Design Week with the notion and mindset of growing it organically. That means expanding and accommodating different versions that we felt the community was ready for. This was further pushed with COVID-19 and festivals around the world adopting new formats.”   The festival is highlighting young talent and promoting the growth of local design communities around the Kingdom. “Whether young or established, all designers all play a big role in building these design communities,” Bouzo said. This community — our design community — will continue to redefine design now and in the future.
