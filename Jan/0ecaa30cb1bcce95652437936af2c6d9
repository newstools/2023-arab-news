The event was attended by more than 300 surgeons specialized in treating hernias in the Kingdom and Arab countries, as well as 300 healthcare workers, in addition to speakers and officials. During the conference, speakers stressed that obesity is the most important factor in the occurrence of hernias in patients. Proper nutrition plays a vital role in avoiding hernias, officials said.
