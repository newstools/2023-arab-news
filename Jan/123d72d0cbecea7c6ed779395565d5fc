BAGHDAD: Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Al-Sudani defended the presence of US troops in his country and set no timetable for their withdrawal, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal published on Sunday.
Referring to the US and NATO troop contingents that train and assist Iraqi units in countering Daesh but largely stay out of combat, Sudani said that the foreign forces are still needed. “Elimination of Daesh needs some more time,” he said in the interview.
Sudani, who took office last October, told the Wall Street Journal that he planned to send a high-level delegation to Washington for talks with US officials next month.
“I don’t see this as an impossible matter, to see Iraq have a good relationship with Iran and the US,” Sudani told the newspaper.
