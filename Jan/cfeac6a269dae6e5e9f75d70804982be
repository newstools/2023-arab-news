RIYADH: The number of people participating in this year’s Hajj will return to pre-pandemic levels, Saudi Arabia’s minister of Hajj and Umrah said on Monday. Speaking at the Hajj Expo 2023 taking place in Jeddah, Tawfiq Al-Rabiah said there would also be no age restrictions during this year’s Hajj. In 2019, about 2.5 million people took part in the pilgrimage. For the next two years, numbers were drastically curtailed to limit the spread of COVID-19 during the pandemic.
