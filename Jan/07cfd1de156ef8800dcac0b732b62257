RIYADH: The Spanish Super Cup final is returning to Riyadh, and Saudi football fans’ mouths are watering. For the latest updates, follow us on Twitter @ArabNewsSport Sunday’s match at the King Fahd International Stadium will be El Clasico, pitting holders Real Madrid against Barcelona. The Catalan team booked their place in the showpiece final with a nail-biting 4-2 penalty shootout victory over Real Betis after 120 minutes of football ended in a 2-2 draw. Carlo Ancelotti’s Madrid side beat Valencia on penalties on Wednesday. The final “will be a very nice game, everyone wants to see this type of game and we’ll be delighted to play it and win it,” Barca’s German goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen said. Ter Stegen made some fine saves even before the semi-final shootout, where he was the key man. “I would like to have less work in games,” he said. “For a year I’ve been at a very good level personally, physically, it’s the work too — every day I have a spectacular team that helps me improve and think about how to get better.” Barcelona have not won the Spanish Super Cup since the change to a four-team format, with the first Saudi tournament taking place in 2020. After finishing last season without a trophy and investing heavily in the summer despite the club’s debts, head coach Xavi and his team are desperate for silverware. Although winning the Super Cup will not be enough in itself, it would be a step in the right direction and Xavi’s first trophy since arriving in November 2021. “Ter Stegen makes the difference for us, I am very happy with him,” the coach said. “He saved two penalties, and we’re in the final. Now we have to compete in it and win it.”
