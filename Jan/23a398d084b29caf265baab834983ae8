RIYADH: The Chief Executive Officer of the Saudi Fund for Development Sultan bin Abdulrahman Al-Murshed on Wednesday received Senegal’s Minister of Planning, Economy, and Cooperation Oulimata Sarr and her accompanying delegation at the fund’s headquarters in Riyadh. During the meeting, they discussed current and future development projects in Senegal, and Sarr thanked the Saudi government for its contribution and support through the SFD toward improving livelihoods, advancing economic development, and achieving sustainable development goals in the west African country. Since 1978, the SFD has implemented 26 projects and development programs worth around $447 million and administrated four grants provided by the Saudi government through the fund, totalling more than $19 million. The funding has been used in the sectors of transportation, communications, infrastructure, health, housing, urban development, energy, education, water, and sanitation. Separately, Al-Murshed met Mali’s Minister of Mines, Energy, and Water Lamine Seydou Traore, and his accompanying delegation, for talks on existing SFD-funded development projects and those under implementation in Mali, and opportunities to enhance development cooperation. The fund has offered 16 development loans to Mali to finance 15 projects in the agriculture, water, transportation, and infrastructure sectors, in addition to administrating four grants provided by the Saudi government to Mali. Al-Murshed also met with the CEO of the Islamic Corporation for the Insurance of Investment and Export Credit Osama bin Abdulrahman Al-Qaisi, and his delegation. Following a briefing on SFD activities, they discussed ongoing development projects and ways to strengthen partnership and cooperation. Al-Qaisi praised the SFD’s help in providing support for developing countries around the world.
