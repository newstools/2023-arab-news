JEDDAH: The “Heart of Arabia” trek led by British explorer Mark Evans reached its final stop at Nasseef House in Jeddah, the Saudi Press Agency reported on Monday. The 1,300-km expedition across Saudi Arabia aims to raise awareness of the Kingdom’s historical relationship with Britain and honor the achievement of John Philby, who traveled a century ago from the Gulf coast village of Al-Uqair to Jeddah, on the Red Sea coast, on a mission in support of Ibn Saud, the Kingdom’s first ruler. The team toured the Nasseef House, one of Jeddah’s architectural highlights located in the Al-Balad district. The restored 40-room coral house became a royal residence for King Abdulaziz after he captured the city in 1925. It is notable for its distinctive architectural features, which include ramps installed to allow camels to walk all the way up to the upper terrace and a cistern at the bottom that collects rainwater.
