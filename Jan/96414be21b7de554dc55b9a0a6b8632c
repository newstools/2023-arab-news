RIYADH: A community-oriented forum that helps people deal with everyday problems ranging from challenging social situations to cyber fraud will begin on Tuesday with more than 60 Saudi government and private agencies and civil society groups taking part. The three-day Derayah Forum will be organized by the Princess Seetah bint Abdulaziz Award for Excellence in Social Work under the title “What if… How do you act?” Prince Saud bin Fahad bin Abdullah bin Mohammed bin Saud Al-Kabeer, vice chairman of the executive committee and member of the award’s board of trustees, said forum continues to focus on the objectives of the Kingdom’s Vision 2030 in order to raise the quality of life of citizens and residents of the Kingdom. “It also aims to improve their daily lifestyle through a number of awareness-raising, preventive and interactive activities,” he said. Fahad Al-Maghlouth, secretary-general of the award, said that the forum helps to improve people’s lives by teaching skills and coping mechanisms to deal with a range of “daily threat situations.” The forum focuses on areas including security and safety, information technology, human rights, health, social and psychological issues, and financial planning. It also aims to expand children’s perceptions of the best and fastest ways to deal with or avoid dangerous situations. Al-Maghlouth said that the forum is aimed at all family members, specialists, consultants, institutions and sectors, governmental, private and nonprofit, residents and visitors in the Kingdom. Workshops on first aid, security risk management, dealing with cyber extortion, and protecting bank accounts from financial fraud will be held at the forum.
