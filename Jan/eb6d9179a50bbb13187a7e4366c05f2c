LONDON: MBC Group on Thursday announced the extension of a partnership with Warner Bros. Discovery to continue offering Hollywood titles on its platforms. The Riyadh-based media company said that it struck an agreement to add Cartoon Network shows to its catalog for audiences across the MENA region. “We have had a strong relationship with Warner Bros. Discovery for two decades and this deal cements it for years to come,” said Sam Barnett, CEO of MBC Group. “The deal allows MBC Group to show some of the biggest theatrical titles by Warner Bros. to our audiences across the Middle East and North Africa, and to expand our Cartoon Network offering across the region,” he said. The newly extended partnership will allow the media company to continue offering the latest Hollywood blockbusters on MBC2 until 2026. Viewers will be able to stream “first-run” box office hits, such as “Tenet,“ “Wonder Woman 1984” and “Joker,” as well as major franchises including Batman, Harry Potter, Fantastic Beasts, and Lord of the Rings. The collaboration will also see the launch of Cartoon Network Arabia channel made available on MBC Group’s Arabic streaming platform Shahid until September 2023. English-language content will also be made available, with an additional 250 episodes of Cartoon Network content expected to be added to a Shahid Kids SVoD hub. “MBC is a highly valued and longstanding partner for Warner Bros. Discovery in MENA. We are happy to have found new ways to deepen our longstanding relationship while reinforcing our commitment to free TV,” Jamie Cooke, GM CEE, Middle East and Turkiye of Warner Bros. Discovery, said.
