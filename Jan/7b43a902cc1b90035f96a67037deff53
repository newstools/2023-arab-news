RIYADH: Saudi industry chiefs on Sunday signed a deal to set up an Animal Protein city in the Jazan region as part of an ambitious project to support the Kingdom’s food sector. The memorandum of understanding was agreed between officials of the Royal Commission for Jubail and Yanbu and the National Livestock and Fisheries Development Program. The agreement was inked in the presence of industry and mineral resources minister and chairman of the commission’s board of directors, Bandar Al-Khorayef, environment, water, and agriculture minister and NFDP board chairman, Abdulrahman Al-Fadli, and commission president, Khalid Al-Salem.
