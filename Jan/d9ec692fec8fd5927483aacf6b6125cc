Ronaldo was given a the ban in November for hitting a mobile phone out of a teenage fan’s hand after Manchester United, his club at the time, lost to Everton in the Premier League.
“The ban is applicable after he is officially registered,” another Al-Nassr official said.
Al-Nassr had not yet registered Ronaldo due to a foreign player quota, but his registration was set to be completed on Friday, sources close to the club said.
Ronaldo, whose deal is worth an estimated 200 million euros to June 2025, is Al Nassr’s ninth foreign player — one more than the eight allowed by Saudi football authorities.
The Portuguese superstar was unveiled to fireworks and deafening cheers from a capacity crowd at a ceremony at the club’s home stadium on Tuesday.
Al-Nassr’s first game since Ronaldo’s arrival was held on Friday at Mrsool Park, in which the home team beat Al-Tai 2-0, after the match had been postponed due to heavy rains in Riyadh. For the latest updates, follow us on Twitter @ArabNewsSport * With AFP
