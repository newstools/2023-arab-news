RIYADH: The 12th Social Dialogue Forum, organized by the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development in cooperation with the King Abdulaziz Center for National Dialogue, was held on Monday in Riyadh. The International Labor Organization and government, employer, and employee representatives participated in the event. Forum delegates discussed opportunities and challenges in the job market in relation to training and rehabilitation programs and their impact on the development of the national cadre’s skills, business models and their role in developing the work environment, and the protection of wages and contract documentation. Minister of Human Resources and Social Development Ahmed Al-Rajhi said the forum aimed to promote social dialogue on the subject matters. He added that the forum was important in, “creating a remarkable work environment for the job market, thus contributing to supporting the national economy, in line with Saudi Vision 2030 and the job market strategy.” The minister noted that last year there were 2.2 million Saudis working in the private sector – the highest percentage in the history of the Kingdom – and 37 percent female participation in the job market. Youssef Ghalab, representative of the ILO, said the Kingdom’s efforts were in response to rapid changes in the job market, and he highlighted the need for a person-led approach and objectives for sustainable development that focused on the importance of social dialogue for policy-making and social justice. Abdullah bin Mohammed Al-Fawzan, secretary-general of the KACND, said: “There is no doubt that social dialogue has greatly contributed to the formulation of policies and programs and development of agreements. “It guarantees reaching consensual policies on issues related to the benefits of partners and their legitimate interests.”
