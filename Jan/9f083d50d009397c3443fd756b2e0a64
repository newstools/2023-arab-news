DIRIYAH: The Diriyah ePrix returns with a doubleheader of races scheduled for late January at the Riyadh Street Circuit. Diriyah, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, hosts the ABB Formula E World Championship races on Jan. 27 and 28. Both races will take place at night, the only such races in the Formula E calendar. In the ninth season of the competition, McLaren and Maserati will be joining established teams such as Jaguar, Porsche, and Nissan in the championship for electric cars. Some 11 teams and 22 drivers will compete for team and individual honors. Races start at 8 p.m. on both dates. Ticket holders will be entertained in the “Allianz-E Village” prior to the start of the action. Maserati driver Edoardo Mortara said: “Diriyah is one of the most advanced circuits in Formula E. “With the emergence of the fastest and lightest Gen3 cars, the track will be a real test of the drivers’ skills.” Alberto Longo, co-founder and CEO of Formula E, said that “the Diriyah ePrix will always be one of the most important events in the calendar.” DS Penske driver Stoffel Vandoorne said: “Racing against the backdrop of the UNESCO World Heritage Site has always been special and the addition of off-circuit entertainment activities will make for a great race weekend.”For the latest updates, follow us on Twitter @ArabNewsSport For the latest updates, follow us on Twitter @ArabNewsSport
