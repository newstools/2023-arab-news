RIYADH: The Camel Club on Wednesday signed an agreement with the International Camel Organization to promote Saudi camel heritage around the world. Bandar Al-Qahtani, Camel Club executive director, and Khalid Al-Ajmi, the ICO’s acting secretary-general inked the deal at the headquarters of King Abdulaziz Camel Festival, located 130 kilometers north Riyadh. The Camel Club was established in 2017 by royal decree with the aim of developing the sector, promoting investment in it, and raising awareness about the Kingdom’s camel heritage. The ICO is a strategic partner in all Camel Club events. Under the terms of the accord, the organization will become a permanent part of King Abdulaziz Camel Festival events as a local and international strategic partner. More than 32 participants from around the world competed last week in a new beauty competition at the seventh edition of the festival, with an Iraqi winning first place with his animal. There were 15 participants — nine from Iraq, two from Egypt, and one each from Yemen, Libya, the UK, and India — who qualified for the final round of judging.
