KUWAIT: Kuwait’s International Islamic Charity Organization and the UN’s High Commissioner for Refugees have signed an agreement to provide humanitarian supplies for Rohingya refugees in Cox’s Bazar in Bangladesh. Bader Al-Sumait, IICO’s directive manager, said: “The organization seeks to ease suffering of the Rohingya people through sustainable development solutions in the fields of agricultural, livestock, and fish production, at a cost of about $500,000.” Kuwait News Agency quoted Al-Sumait saying: “About 1 million displaced people from this Muslim minority… depend entirely on humanitarian aid to obtain protection, food, water, shelter, and health services.” The supportive measures and humanitarian aid include sustainable development plans, in addition to food and shelter. Al-Sumait added: “Sustainable activities might change, in a better way, the circumstances of these communities, mainly in education, economic empowerment, and building abilities.” He said that the IICO has cooperation and partnership agreements with 13 agencies, organizations and international networks, of which 12 are effective alliances through joint projects or studies that are being worked on.
