RIYADH: Saudi Arabia strongly condemned and denounced on Monday a suicide bombing that took place at a mosque in Peshawar, Pakistan. A suicide bomber struck a crowded mosque inside a police compound in Pakistan, causing the roof to collapse and killing at least 47 people and wounding more than 150 others, officials said. The attack happened during afternoon worship in the provincial capital of Peshawar, close to former tribal areas along the Afghan border. The Kingdomâ€™s foreign ministry said Saudi Arabia rejects the targeting of places of worship, terrorizing people, and shedding innocent blood. The ministry said it stands by Pakistan in the face of violence, extremism, and terrorism, regardless of motives or justifications. The ministry offered condolences and sympathy to the families of the victims and to the government and people of Pakistan. It also wished the injured a speedy recovery.
