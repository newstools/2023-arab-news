RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s Communications, Space and Technology Commission has called on the public to vote for Saudi projects competing to win the ITU-sponsored World Summit on the Information Society prizes 2023. The commission is aiming to support the national projects’s endeavors to compete globally and stimulate the development of all sectors digitally, the Saudi Press Agency reported on Saturday. The commission said that Saudi Arabia is taking part in the 2023 competition with 31 national projects affiliating to 19 governmental and private agencies. The voting is available via https://www.itu.int/net4/wsis/stocktaking/Prizes/2023 until Jan. 25. Saudi Arabia has collected 12 prizes and 30 certificates of excellence through its participation in the WSIS since its inception in 2012. Last year, the Saudi Ministry of Environment, Water and Agriculture was awarded the World Summit on the Information Society Forum’s 2022 Prize for E-Agriculture and E-Service, in recognition of services provided by the Naama Portal. The ministry saw off global competition from 947 competitors during three phases of the award process to claim the prize. The award was based on many factors, the foremost of which include “completing technical requirements and standards aligning with United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, constructing digital platforms and using cutting-edge digital agricultural technology.”
