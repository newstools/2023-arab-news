RIYADH: The online platform for the second international Qur’an recitation and adhan (call to prayer) competition has received entries from more than 100 countries. Potential contestants uploaded audio clips for the competition — which is the largest of its kind in the world — in a bid to get through the online stages and earn a place on the “Otr Elkalam” TV show. Chairman of the Saudi General Entertainment Authority, Turki Al-Sheikh, announced the initial registrations for the contest on Jan. 4. Those competing can qualify for the later stages by putting in impressive television appearances, giving them a chance of winning prizes for their recitations. A jury of experts in the recitation of the Qur’an and maqamat (musical structures) will determine those participants qualifying for the latter stages. Intonation, sweetness of voice and the contestant’s ability to control it, along with performance and clarity, the mastery of tajwid (correct pronunciation), and reciting without stuttering or hesitation, will all be assessed. The competition, which is supervised by the General Entertainment Authority, offers equal opportunities for all contestants, and aims to highlight the most melodious voices reciting the Qur’an and adhan. The show will be broadcast during the month of Ramadan on the MBC TV channel and the Shahid digital platform, with prizes amounting to more than SR12 million ($3.2 million). The contest is designed to highlight the rich diversity of cultures in the Islamic world, and the vocal methods of reciting the Qur’an and raising the call to prayer.
