WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden will receive and hold talks with Jordan’s King Abdullah at the White House on Thursday, the Jordanian embassy in Washington said on Tuesday. The king is in Washington and met with US House of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthy at the Capitol earlier on Tuesday. “Talks will cover means to bolster the strategic partnership and ties of friendship between Jordan and the US through expanding cooperation across various sectors,” Jordan’s royal court said. Discussions will also include regional and international developments, especially those connected to the Palestinian cause and the US role in this regard, and the consequences of the Ukraine crisis.
