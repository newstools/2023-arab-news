Beefbar, a restaurant first established in Monte Carlo, has now become a part of Riyadhâ€™s bustling Tahlia Street. International dishes and specially sourced meats are served in an opulent setting inspired by Art Nouveau. Using top-quality products for its international and local recipes, the eatery offers street cuisine, entrees, and sides in the primary categories of beef, reef, and leaf. Its architecture and romantic ambiance have made it a popular venue for couples as well as celebrities and influencers. The leaf section of the menu includes rock corn, which is popcorn in tempura, spicy mayonnaise, and a Lebanese fattoush salad with fresh creamy stracciatella.
