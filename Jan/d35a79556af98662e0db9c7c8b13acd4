RIYADH: Balazs Selmeci, the Hungarian ambassador to Saudi Arabia, met with the Shoura Council’s Saudi-Hungarian Parliamentary Friendship Committee in Riyadh to discuss bilateral relations between the two countries. “The Saudi-Hungarian Parliamentary Friendship Committee in the Shoura Council held a meeting chaired by council member Ibrahim Al-Qannas with the Ambassador of the Republic of Hungary to the Kingdom,” the council tweeted on Tuesday. During the meeting held in the presence of members of the committee, the two sides stressed the importance of bilateral relations between the Kingdom and Hungary, and the need to boost ties in various fields. They also discussed issues of joint interest to help enhance relations at the parliamentary level. The two countries share cordial relations and are preparing for the fourth Hungarian-Saudi Joint Economic Commission in 2023. Through the Hungarian-Saudi Joint Economic Commission, the ambassador hopes to see Hungarian companies working in the Kingdom and contributing to Saudi Vision 2030, the Kingdom’s reform plan. Earlier in 2014, the Hungarian Embassy organized the first Arab-Hungarian Business Forum in Riyadh with 150 domestic companies taking part. The parliamentary friendship committees of the Shoura Council aim to strengthen ties with parliaments in friendly countries and boost cooperation at the international level.
