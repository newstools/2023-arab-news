For the latest updates, follow us on Twitter @ArabNewsSport Admiral Lord West said the event will face “serious security issues” due to the risk of reprisal because of the prince’s comments, Metro newspaper reported. Prince Harry wrote in his newly released memoir “Spare” that he had killed 25 Taliban fighters while serving as a helicopter pilot in Afghanistan. West said: “The Invictus Games is very much labeled to him and so I would have thought the threat level there will definitely be higher. “There will be serious security issues because of what he said. Measures will have to be put in place to protect the veterans. And there will be people who, given half the chance, will want to do something. “The Taliban will be reading (Harry’s claims about killing fighters and) thinking there’s this prince calling us all chess pieces and is quite happy about killing us. “And there will be a lot of people, I am sure, in Daesh and other terrorist organizations, who will think this is something which should be avenged.”
