LONDON: A man was allegedly stabbed to death by an Afghan asylum seeker while attempting to break up an argument over an e-scooter, a UK court has heard. Thomas Roberts, 21, was knifed twice outside a sandwich shop in the English town of Bournemouth on March 12 last year. Afghan migrant Lawangeen Abdulrahimzai, also 21, who was seen on CCTV fleeing the scene, is currently on trial at Salisbury Crown Court charged with the murder of Roberts. Prosecutor Nic Lobbenberg told the court the victim had been enjoying a “very chilled” evening with a friend, James Medway, before Medway became involved in an altercation with Abdulrahimzai over a hired e-scooter. Lobbenberg said: “There was an altercation with this defendant. Thomas Roberts was a peacemaker, he came between the two men, for his trouble, he received two stab wounds.” He added that the first stab wound hit the victim’s heart, the second hit his stomach. “James Medway says to Tom, ‘we do not need to get a taxi home, we can scoot — it’s not being used, we can take it,’ and gets on it,” he said. “He is immediately confronted by the defendant. Tom comes between them, and the defendant gets in Tom’s face and is very aggressive. “The defendant is getting in Tom’s face, he (Tom) slaps the defendant in the face with an open palm, at that, the defendant draws a knife and stabs him twice,” he added. The court heard that Abdulrahimzai did not deny carrying out the stabbing using a knife he had taken with him from home, and previously pleaded guilty to manslaughter, but denies murder. Abdulrahimzai was born in Afghanistan and arrived in the UK in late 2019. He told arresting officers he was 16, but the court has since determined that he is 21.
