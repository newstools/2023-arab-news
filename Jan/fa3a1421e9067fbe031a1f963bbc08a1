DUBAI: Video-streaming platform Starzplay has signed an agreement with New Media Academy to broadcast the next three seasons of Arabic edutainment show “Al-Daheeh.” As part of the deal it secured the exclusive rights to stream each episode two weeks before any other platform. “Since its launch in 2020 by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al-Maktoum, Vice-President (and) Prime Minister (of the UAE,) and Ruler of Dubai, the New Media Academy has sought to develop the creative landscape within the Arab world through positive educational content aimed at Arab youth to meet the need for more digital-learning platforms,” said Hussein Al-Atouli, the academy’s acting executive director. The partnership with Starzplay is part of the academy’s efforts to produce enhanced “digital content in the region that arms future generations with knowledge,” he added. The first two seasons of “Al-Daheeh” are already streaming on Starzplay and the third season started on Jan. 7. The series, which began as a YouTube show devised by Egyptian content creator Ahmed Al-Ghandour, aims to provide simple explanations of educational topics in subjects such as natural sciences, economics, technology and history in an entertaining and humorous manner. The first two seasons attracted more than 300 million views and 30 million interactions on various digital platforms. Several episodes made it onto the list of the most-watched YouTube videos in the Middle East and North Africa region. “Al-Daheeh” also ranked among the top shows in the premium Arabic content category among Saudi viewers on Starzplay last year. “The addition of the next three seasons of ‘Al Daheeh’ to our platform falls in line with Starzplay’s strategy to provide high-quality Arabic content to our over 2.1 million subscribers across 19 countries in the MENA region,” said Nadim Dada, the streamer’s vice president of programming and content acquisition.
