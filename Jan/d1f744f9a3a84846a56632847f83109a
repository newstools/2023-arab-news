AMMAN: Jordan’s lower house speaker Ahmed Safadi and Algeria’s lower assembly speaker Ibrahim Boghali met in Algeria to discuss enhancing cooperation.
Safadi said: “We are proud of the level of strong relations between the two countries, which culminated in a summit that brought together King Abdullah II and his brother President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, last month in Algiers.”
He noted the importance of building on the summit recommendations and that MPs must overcome legislative obstacles to further cooperation, Jordan’s News Agency reported on Friday.
Boghali said Algeria supported the Hashemite Custodianship of Islamic and Christian holy sites in occupied Jerusalem. He said issues discussed in the summit between Tebboune and King Abdullah demonstrated the importance of the Palestinian cause for both countries.
