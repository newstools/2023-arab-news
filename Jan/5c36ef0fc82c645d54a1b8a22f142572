RIYADH: The Muslim World League has expressed its strong condemnation and denunciation of the terror attack on a mosque in Peshawar, Pakistan, which resulted in more than 100 deaths. MWL Secretary General Dr. Mohammed bin Abdulkarim Al-Isa stressed the organization’s firm rejection of terrorism and the targeting of places of worship. The MWL offered its condolences and sympathy to the families of the victims and to the government and people of Pakistan, wishing the injured a speedy recovery. At least 100 people were killed and more than 200 injured on Monday when a Taliban suicide bomb blast ripped through a mosque inside a fortified security compound in Pakistan. Authorities used heavy machinery to cut into the debris of the mosque’s collapsed building as part of a rescue operation. The Pakistani Taliban admitted to carrying out the attack. Bombings have been on the rise since last November when the group called off a ceasefire signed with the government in May. Monday’s attack was the worst in Peshawar since March 2022 when a Daesh suicide bombing killed at least 58 people in a mosque during Friday prayers. Secretary-General of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation Hissein Brahim Taha expressed his condemnation of the “heinous act” and offered his deepest condolences to the families of the victims. Taha renewed the position of the OIC against all forms and manifestations of terrorism, stressing his organization’s support for the government of Pakistan in tackling extremism. Secretary-General of the Gulf Cooperation Council Nayef Falah Al-Hajraf affirmed the council’s solidarity with the government of Pakistan in confronting terrorism and extremism. He reiterated the GCC’s firm stance against terrorism in all its forms, stressing the council’s condemnation of the bombing, which “contradicts all human laws and values.”
