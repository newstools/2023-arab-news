RIYADH: Authorities in Saudi Arabia thwarted an attempt to smuggle over 3 million amphetamine tablets into the Kingdom, the General Directorate for Drug Control said on Wednesday. Maj. Mohammed Al-Nujaidi, the spokesman for the Kingdom’s anti-drug authority, stated that during a “security follow-up of drug smuggling and promotion networks targeting the security of the Kingdom and its youth,” authorities managed to thwart an attempt to smuggle 3,049,451 tablets of amphetamine hidden inside compartments of a truck. Al-Nujaidi said the operation was done in coordination with the Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority, adding that three Saudi nationals have been arrested in the capital, Riyadh, and in the Eastern Province. Preliminary legal measures have been taken against them and they have been referred to the Public Prosecution, Al-Nujaidi added.
