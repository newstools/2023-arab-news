TURAIF: Turaif governorate in the Northern Borders Region on Thursday registered the lowest temperature in the Kingdom’s cities and governorates, at zero Celsius, according to a report by the National Meteorology Center. The center warned that severe weather would continue until Friday with torrential rains that could be accompanied by hail, fog with low visibility, and high waves along the coast. “Thunderstorms will continue in most areas in the Kingdom starting from Sunday, Jan. 1 to Friday, Jan. 6, 2023,” the center tweeted on Monday. In late December, heavy downpours disrupted flights in and out of Jeddah, with rain in various cities in Saudi Arabia, including Riyadh, forcing people to remain indoors. King Abdulaziz International Airport announced that several flights were delayed due to the weather, requesting passengers to get in touch with the relevant authorities and airlines about rescheduling. Due to the inclement weather, several areas of Jeddah also became waterlogged, with the city readying equipment and manpower to deal with any emergencies. The concerned authorities across the Kingdom continued their assistance and advised people to take caution during the rain and not to leave their homes except in emergencies.
