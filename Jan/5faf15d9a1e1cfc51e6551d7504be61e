Suspected militants have abducted roughly 50 women in a part of northern Burkina Faso that is regularly hit by violence, local officials and residents told AFP.
Roughly 40 were seized about a dozen kilometres (miles) southeast of Arbinda on Thursday and about 20 others were abducted on Friday to the north of the town, with some escaping in the meantime, the sources said on condition of anonymity.
