RIYADH: Houthi allegations of shelling on the Saadah districts of Shada and Munabbih are “baseless,” the Coalition to Restore Legitimacy in Yemen said on Sunday. “What is being circulated comes within the context of ongoing Houthi allegations in areas under its control that represent hotspots for disputes,” the coalition said. The statement also said that crime was rife in areas managed by the Houthis. The coalition said it supported efforts to stabilize the truce in Yemen that ended in October 2022, and that it exercised the highest levels of restraint in light of continued Houthi violations on the border with Yemen and inside the country.
