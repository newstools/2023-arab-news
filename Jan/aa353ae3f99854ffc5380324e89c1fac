LONDON: The Israeli TV series “Fauda” has topped the list of most streamed Netflix shows in Lebanon, as well as hitting the top 10 in the UAE, Jordan, Qatar and Morocco. Much of the action in the show’s fourth season, which premiered on Netflix on Jan. 20, is set in Lebanon. The action begins with former Israel Defense Force operative Doron working on a vineyard after being expelled from his combat unit. But he returns to work after learning that an enemy he thought he had killed is still alive. The mission takes him across Israel, Lebanon and Belgium, though the action was actually shot in Israel and Ukraine. The show’s co-creator Avi Issacharoff told The Times of Israel that the plot of the latest season was based on a true story. Topping the charts is a new high for “Fauda,” whose third season, released in 2020, was one of the most watched Netflix shows in the Arab world.
