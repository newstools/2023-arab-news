The three-person team had rowed about 3,463 km in 29 days at sea by Monday night, after battling storms, 15-meter waves, extreme heat, and close calls with cargo ships.
The team are active for 24 hours a day on a rota of two hours of rowing and one hour’s rest in a boat a little bigger than the average family car.
They are completely self-reliant, carrying all the food, medical supplies and equipment they need to complete what is expected to be a 50 to 60-day crossing.
Toby Gregory, team founder and captain for the crossing, said: “Given the extreme weather conditions we have faced, I couldn’t be more proud of our team.
“No matter what has come our way we have never given up. It’s been the ultimate team effort”.
The UN’s Clean Seas initiative has partnered Gregory and his team on their journey, part of which involves the crew taking samples from the ocean as they travel.
Gregory added: “There is an abundance of life in our ocean. It’s a magical place and one which must be protected.
“I have seen first hand plastics and pollution in the middle of our oceans. It’s heartbreaking to see.
“We all have a collective responsibility to stop this, and by working together I’m sure we can.”
The team are currently four days ahead of schedule and should arrive in Antigua between Jan. 24 and 29. For the latest updates, follow us on Twitter @ArabNewsSport
