ABU DHABI: A man has been arrested for attempting to smuggle 4.5 million Captagon pills into the UAE inside tins of green beans. Taher Gharib Al-Dhaheri, head of anti-narcotics at Abu Dhabi Police, said the authorities received a tipoff about the suspect’s intentions and apprehended him following a monitoring operation. The drugs were discovered inside tins labeled as green beans and for which the suspect had completed the necessary import paperwork, he said. In a statement on social media, Al-Dhaheri said the arrest was thanks to a covert surveillance operation which led to police raiding a warehouse in an undisclosed location. The value of the drugs was not revealed, but their estimated street value would be between $60 million and $100 million based on figures published in the International Addiction Review journal. Enter
