CAIRO: Development work at the Suez Canal Economic Zone is progressing well, a senior official said, with the new berth at Sokhna port recently welcoming its first cruise ships. Walid Youssef, deputy chairman of the southern part of the zone, said that the circulation and reception of vessels was “working perfectly” alongside the construction work, which was nearing completion. The development included four new basins and 18 km of marine berths, as well as commercial and logistical areas covering 5.3 sq. km, he said. The area is served by a rail network stretching 33 km, which also connects to the Sokhna-El Alamein electric train service. Youssef said there was constant coordination with the relevant authorities to ensure the smooth operation of the port as the work progressed. On Saturday, the port welcomed the cruise ship Splendida MSC with 2,826 passengers aboard. It was en route from Yanbu to Safaga. It also received the Emerald Azzurra, carrying 75 tourists from Sharm El-Sheikh, and the Clio, which had traveled from Hurghada with 85 passengers.
