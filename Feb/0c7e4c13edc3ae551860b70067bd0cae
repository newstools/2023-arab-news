DUBAI: A Jordanian woman is being investigated for allegedly faking her own death and funeral, using a dummy corpse, in an attempt to trick insurance companies into paying out $2 million.
Authorities said the woman, working with a number of accomplices, took out life insurance policies with three insurers, Sky News Arabia reported. Her death was announced in October 2022, and a funeral and memorial event took place.
A Jordanian security official said lawyers contacted the insurance companies to claim the payouts on the policies, worth a total of $2 million. According to media reports, the companies became suspicious when the claimants failed to provide copies of official medical reports, and they alerted the police. As part of the investigation, the “body” was exhumed and found to be a plastic doll wrapped in a white shroud.
The Jordan Insurance Federation alerted all insurers about the case and told them to cooperate with police and other agencies to help prevent future fraudulent schemes and to investigate any previous suspicious cases.
