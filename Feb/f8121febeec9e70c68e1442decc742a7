RIYADH: The Saudi Cabinet reiterated on Tuesday the Kingdom’s support for Turkiye after a devastating earthquake struck its southern region, in a statement carried by the Saudi Press Agency. The Cabinet said it was “following developments of the humanitarian situation following the earthquake, and the Kingdom's efforts to reduce its effects on the peoples of Turkey and Syria, through participating in rescue work and sending aid that includes food, medical and shelter materials.” More than 158,000 people have evacuated the vast swathe of southern Turkiye hit by the quake, one of the deadliest tremors in the region's modern history.
The disaster, with a combined death toll in Turkiye and neighboring Syria now exceeding 37,000, has devastated whole cities in both countries, leaving survivors homeless in the bitter cold, at times sleeping on piles of rubble. So far, the kingdom has sent eight planes with aid to help those affected by the earthquake in Turkiye and Syria.
