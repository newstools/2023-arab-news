Over the past 12 years, Fadan has played a pivotal role in building Telfaz11 into what it is today. Under his leadership, Telfaz11 has become one of the most prominent media companies in the region, representing a new generation of local creators and storytellers and crafting an ambitious vision for the evolving Saudi media industry. Telfaz11’s innovative approach to storytelling and production has put Saudi content on the world map.
