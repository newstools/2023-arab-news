ABU DHABI: The Abu Dhabi Exports Office, the export-financing arm of Abu Dhabi Fund for Development, has signed two green finance agreements with the government of Angola, worth a total value  of $121.3 million, Emirates News Agency reported on Friday. One agreement, which is worth $90 million, pertains to the acquisition of an analytical platform, main data center, backup data center, and national cloud platform to boost the Angolan IT sector. The second agreement, worth $31.3 million, will allow Mark Cables, a Dubai-based company specializing in manufacturing cables, lighting, water, and electrification projects, to install street lights in the cities of Luanda, Malanje, N’dalatando and Uige. “The two agreements constitute an important starting point for a new phase of developmental cooperation with the government of Angola,” said ADFD Director General Mohamed Saif Al-Suwaidi. “They contribute to building efficient partnerships to support the development of modern, environment-friendly infrastructure in Angola in cooperation with well-established UAE companies, as well as companies based in Angola. These activities will also contribute to the efforts to diversify the UAE’s economy.” Vera Esperanca dos Santos Daves De Sousa, Angola’s minister of finance, lauded the UAE for its effort to expand economic cooperation with Angola, explaining that the agreements would allow her government to develop data, financial and educational services, and install sustainable street lighting systems in major cities. De Sousa said she hoped to broaden the scope of opportunities for Angola-UAE development cooperation.
