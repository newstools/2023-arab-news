AMMAN: Jordan’s armed forces have sent a field hospital and the medical team to staff it to Turkiye to help treat victims of the earthquake that struck the south of the country on Monday.
Maj. Gen. Yousef Huneiti, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, met the medics before they departed, passed on the greetings of King Abdullah, told them to help those in need, and urged them to be good ambassadors for the Jordanian Armed Forces, the Jordan News Agency reported on Friday.
“The field hospital was equipped in record time and under the direct supervision of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as time in such circumstances is an important factor,” said Brig. Gen. Hassan Shanatwah, the JAF’s director of military operations. “This reflects the high readiness of our armed forces to deal with such circumstances and developments.”
The Royal Jordanian Air Force transported the hospital, including its medical team of 110 doctors, nurses and administrators. It can provide specialist treatments and surgeries for a range of injuries affecting orthopedics, arteries, blood vessels, the face and jaw, chest, nerves and children, along with accident and emergency facilities, cosmetic surgeons, a radiology laboratory, a pharmacy, two operating theaters, an ambulance, and various medical and therapeutic aids.
