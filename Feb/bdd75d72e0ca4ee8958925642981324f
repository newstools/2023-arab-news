TEHRAN: A helicopter carrying Iran’s sports minister crashed Thursday in the country’s south, killing one of his aides and injuring him as well as 15 other people, state media reported.
The minister, Hamid Sajjadi, suffered a head injury in the accident which occurred when the helicopter was landing at a stadium in Baft, a town in Kerman province, the official IRNA news agency said.
His adviser, Esmail Ahmadi, died and another 16 people including the minister, four crew members and other officials were injured, IRNA added, citing the Red Crescent.
“The minister has a brain haemorrhage, but his general condition is stable,” Mohammad Saberi, the head of the Red Crescent in the province, said on television.
“The Red Crescent helicopter hit the ground when it was landing and had been a few meters (yards) off the ground,” IRNA said.
Sanctions-hit Iran has suffered several air disasters in recent years, with officials complaining of difficulties in acquiring spare parts to keep its aging fleets in the air.
