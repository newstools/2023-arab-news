RIYADH: King Faisal University, represented by the college of engineering, qualified for the second phase of the Shell Eco-marathon Asia 2023, a regional energy efficiency contest that will be held in Indonesia in July. The university qualified with its electric KFU Car project for a single-seater urban vehicle that is environmentally friendly. The car’s internal structure, auxiliary equipment and electrical circuits were installed as part of the project. Mohammed Al-Ohali, rector of the university, said during a reception for the project team members that this achievement is a paradigm shift that aims to achieve the Saudi Vision 2030 goals. “These include developing human capacities, national industries and logistics, and reflecting the university’s institutional identity related to energy and environment, in particular.” Shell Eco-marathon Asia 2023 is a regional competition that encourages energy efficiency and consists of three phases. The first phase involves the preparation of the design and engineering drawings, the second concerns preparation of the internal structure, and the third concludes with testing of the car on a racetrack. Teams from across the Asia-Pacific and Middle East will have a final demonstration at the Pertamina Mandalika International Street Circuit in Lombok, Indonesia.
