MANCHESTER, England: Manchester United fought back from a two-goal deficit to draw 2-2 with Leeds in the Premier League on Wednesday. For the latest updates, follow us on Twitter @ArabNewsSport Substitute Jadon Sancho rescued a point for Erik ten Hag’s team, which missed the chance to move level on points with second-place Manchester City. Leeds fired Jesse Marsch on Monday. They are still waiting for a first win in the league since Nov. 5, but moved a point clear of the relegation zone. Both teams, however, will feel they missed the opportunity to take more from the thrilling match at Old Trafford. Leeds stunned the home crowd by taking the lead after just 55 seconds through Wilfried Gnonto and looked on course for victory when Raphael Varane deflected Crysencio Summerville’s cross into his own net three minutes after halftime. United got back into the game through Marcus Rashford’s header in the 62nd and Sancho equalized in the 70th. But on a night when United were looking to cut the gap on leader Arsenal to five points, it remains seven behind the London club having played two more games.
