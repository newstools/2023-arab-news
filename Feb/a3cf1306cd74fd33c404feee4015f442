RIYADH: About 15 million visitors from around the world have now attended Riyadh Calendar events, according to the General Entertainment Authority. Visitors were drawn by the wide variety of international and local entertainment on offer, chairman Turki Al-Sheikh said. Many events, especially those held during the Founding Day celebrations in Boulevard Riyadh City, sold out rapidly, he added. The Riyadh Calendar encompasses a vast collection of events, festivals and exhibitions that give visitors the chance to experience and enjoy the cultures and customs of many different nations. Events are continuously being organized in the dedicated entertainment zones, which have also provided a huge economic benefit to local communities by creating jobs and nurturing investment. The events have also attracted foreign investment, which has enhanced the entertainment sector in the Kingdom. The 15 million visitor milestone is testimony to the efforts of the GEA to provide high quality entertainment for all kinds of people.
