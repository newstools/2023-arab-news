One of the works at auction features a lithography that Picasso created a few years after the end of the second world war, in 1949. Picasso was particularly passionate about this technique, where stone or metal are treated in a way that it can be painted or printed on. Another of the Picasso paintings was created in 1945, using the gouache technique with opaque watercolor and ink on paper. The third artwork in the onlinr auction is “Like an Animal,” which he created in 1957. The auction will also present artwork by Alredhwan, the mother of Sheikh Humaid Bin Khalid Al-Qasimi from the ruling family of Ras Al-Khaimah. A post shared by Humaid Bin Khalid Al Qasimi (@humaidalqasimi) The work is dedicated to the UAE’s 50-year anniversary. It was displayed for six months at the UAE pavilion during EXPO 2020 Dubai and is now available to the public for the first time. “For us, art is an important channel to connect with society,” said Sheikh Al-Qasimi in a released statement. “It is about accessibility. One aspect of this initiative is that sharing our own artwork with the people brings us closer to the public. Another aspect is that technology enables shared ownership, which allows for more people to access this art.”
