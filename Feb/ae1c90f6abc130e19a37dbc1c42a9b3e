RIYADH: Dr. Hala Al-Tuwaijri, president of both the Human Rights Commission and the National Committee to Combat Human Trafficking, stressed that Saudi Arabia has been paying special attention to combating human trafficking and improving its legislative and institutional systems in order to do so.
Al-Tuwaijri’s remarks came during a recent meeting in Riyadh with ambassadors and representatives of countries that export laborers to the Kingdom. During the meeting, several topics related to combating human trafficking and international cooperation in this regard were discussed.
“Saudi Arabia has enhanced its efforts in the fight against human trafficking and has strengthened punitive measures against such crimes, in addition to establishing specialized prosecution offices to investigate and follow up on such offenses,” Al-Tuwaijri said.
Al-Tuwaijri added that Saudi Arabia’s leadership places human dignity at the heart of its approach to handling human trafficking issues and is committed to safeguarding human rights and ensuring that all people are treated equally without any discrimination.
Mohammed Al-Masri, general secretary of the National Committee to Combat Trafficking, told Arab News that trafficking in persons is a transnational crime that requires regional and international cooperation. He said this annual consultative meeting is an opportunity to enhance cooperation and coordination in combating this crime. It also goes in line with the objectives of the Anti-Trafficking National Action Plan, launched by the committee, which retains a central focus on the foundational pillars of Saudi anti-trafficking efforts: prevention, protection, prosecution, and partnerships.
