LONDON: Netflix on Thursday announced the official release date for the second season of Saudi TV show “Masameer County,” and revealed some of the key art for the upcoming episodes. The new episodes of the smash hit animated series, which has taken the Kingdom by storm, will premier on March 2. “The second season of ‘Masameer County’ builds on the first season, only bolder and bigger,” Malik Nejer, one of the creators of the series, told Arab News. “This season will see the usual suspects get into more complex stories, with a signature ‘Masameer’ comedic twist. We know the fans have been anxiously waiting and they are in for a treat.”   The new season will include six episodes featuring the same cast of beloved, mischievous characters audiences got to know and love in season one, producers said, who will get involved in various wild escapades, including a daring 24-hour mission, an unexpected elevator ride, and an out-of-control rocket launch. Created by Nejer and Abdulaziz Almuzaini, “Masameer County” offers a darkly comic take on the evolving social landscape of Saudi Arabia and producers promise the second season will continue to reflect and address the process of change the Kingdom is undergoing.  The first season, which debuted on Netflix in July 2021, was praised for showcasing Saudi artistic creativity in a “shocking, stunning, hilarious and wild” way, while posing awareness-raising questions about sensitive themes through an “apolitical” approach. “Masameer County” is produced as part of a five-year exclusive partnership signed by Netflix and Saudi animation studio Myrkott in 2020 to create Saudi-focused TV shows and films.
