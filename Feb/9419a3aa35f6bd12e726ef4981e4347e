But his agent Nana Sechere tweeted an update on Tuesday that they still have not been able to locate him. “I am at the quake site in Hatay with Christian’s family. The scenes are unimaginable and our hearts are broken for all the people affected,” Sechere tweeted “Yesterday we received confirmation that thermal imagery was showing signs of up to five lives, however, I am told that the only real confirmation of life is through sight, smell and sound, and unfortunately we were not able to locate Christian,” he added. “Things are moving incredibly slow and as a result of that many rescues are being delayed, and lives are being lost due to the lack of resources available to the workers. “It is unfortunate that the club is not on the ground with us, side by side, in the search for Christian.” Sechere has urged Hatayspor and the mayor of Hatay to provide more resources to support rescue services. Claire Rupio, Atsu’s partner, has called for equipment to be sent to the collapsed building where he was residing, Sky News reported.
