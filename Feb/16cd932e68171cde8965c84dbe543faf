DUBAI: Joining a chorus of support, regional art fair Art Dubai announced on Tuesday it will be donating 50 per cent of the online ticket revenue from its coming March event to support earthquake relief efforts in Syria and Turkey. For the latest updates, follow us on Instagram @arabnews.lifestyle “Our thoughts are with all those affected by the Turkey-Syria earthquake. While the aftermath of this horrific event is still being assessed, we will be donating 50% of proceeds from Art Dubai’s online ticket sales for this year’s fair, to registered charities supporting the victims of this tragedy,” a post on their official Instagram page read. A post shared by Art Dubai (@artdubai) Last year, the annual art event donated 25 per cent of its ticket sales proceeds to Ukrainian refugees, amid the country’s conflict with Russia. The 16th edition of Art Dubai will take place at Madinat Jumeirah, Dubai from March 3 - 5. The gallery program will feature over 130 presentations from more than 40 countries and six continents, across four sections: Contemporary, Modern, Bawwaba (featuring exclusively new work) and Art Dubai Digital, and will include more than 30 first-time participants. Further highlights of the 2023 program include a series of 10 newly commissioned performance works by artists from across South Asia.
