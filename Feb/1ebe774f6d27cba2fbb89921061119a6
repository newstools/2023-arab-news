RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Ministry strongly condemned Israeli forces on Wednesday after they stormed into a major Palestinian city in the occupied West Bank. The four-hour raid, which the Israeli military said was to find wanted militants, took place in Nablus and triggered a fierce gun battle that killed at least 10 Palestinians and wounded scores of others. Among the dead were two Palestinian men, aged 72 and 61, and a 16-year-old boy, according to health officials. The ministry reiterated the Kingdom’s rejection of the severe violations of international law carried out by Israeli forces. It called on the international community to assume its responsibilities to end the occupation, stop escalation and Israeli aggression, and provide civilians with necessary protection. The ministry also expressed the Kingdom’s sincere condolences to the families of the victims, as well as to the government and people of Palestine, while wishing the injured a speedy recovery.
