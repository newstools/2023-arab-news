RIYADH: The Saudi Ministry of Industry and Mineral Resources has concluded its participation in the Mining Indaba Conference, which was hosted by South Africa and ended on Feb. 9. Deputy Minister of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources, Khalid bin Saleh Al-Midaifer, who led the Saudi delegation at the conference, cast light on the mining opportunities in the Kingdom and the organizational and legislative framework which had made it attractive to investors.   He held meetings with several government and senior officials representing the large companies which attended the event.
As part of its “Invest in Saudi Arabia” initiative, the ministry held a meeting with investors on the sidelines of the conference to showcase the continuing efforts and reforms to promote the mining sector in the Kingdom to attract foreign investment.
Saudi Arabia attracted a record amount of investment of $32 billion last year.
The accomplishments include de-risking investments in mining exploration, production and processing, growing value chains in gold, phosphate and aluminum, as well as beginning to develop an electric vehicle ecosystem.
