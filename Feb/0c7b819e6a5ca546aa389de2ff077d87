LONDON: Iraqi cleric Moqtada Al-Sadr urged MBC Group on Tuesday to cancel plans to broadcast a TV series about Umayyad caliph Muawiyah bin Abi Sufyan, saying that the historical figure was “divisive.” “Muawiyah,” which explores the life of the 7th-century ruler, is set to air during Ramadan. The series has reportedly cost about $75 million to produce, making it one of the most ambitious works in the history of Arab drama, according to media reports. “Broadcasting such series contradicts the new, moderate policies pursued by the brotherly country Saudi Arabia,” Al-Sadr tweeted on Tuesday. He said that airing the series would “hurt the feelings” of Muslims around the world. pic.twitter.com/ZFsENpflP6 — مقتدى السيد محمد الصدر (@Mu_AlSadr) February 14, 2023 Filming of “Muawiya,” written by Egyptian journalist Khaled Salah and directed by Palestinian-American Tarek Al-Arian, began in July 2022 and has been taking place in Hammamet and Kairouan in Tunisia. Muawiyah bin Abi Sufyan is played by Syrian actor Loujain Ismail, after Palestinian artist Ali Suleiman withdrew from the role. Other actors in the production include Asma Jalal, Aisha bin Ahmed, Jamila Chihi and Iyad Nassar, who has been cast as Imam Ali bin Abi Talib. MBC has not yet responded to Al-Sadr’s statement.
