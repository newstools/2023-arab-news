UNITED NATIONS: The United Arab Emirates told the UN Security Council that it will not call a vote on Monday on a draft resolution demanding Israel “immediately and completely cease all settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territory,” according to a note seen by Reuters.
“Given the positive talks between the parties, we are now working on a draft PRST (presidential statement) which would garner consensus,” the note, send on Sunday, said. “Accordingly, there will not be a vote on the draft resolution on Monday. Much of the language of the PRST will be drawn from the draft resolution.”
