KUALA LUMPUR: Saudi Arabia’s Minister of Hajj and Umrah Dr. Tawfiq Al-Rabiah and his accompanying delegation met Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim at Perdana Putra in Putrajaya on Tuesday. During the meeting, they discussed bilateral relations between the two countries and issues related to the quota for Hajj and Umrah. They also discussed initiatives that can be implemented to improve cooperation in tourism, education, investment and trade. The Malaysian prime minister also praised the services provided by the Kingdom to Hajj and Umrah pilgrims. Recently, the Ministry of Hajj and Umrah launched a program to train the leaders of foreign Hajj pilgrim groups before their arrival in the Kingdom. The first session was held in Tabung Haji, Kuala Lumpur, and was attended by more than 30 group leaders. The aim of the program is to improve the quality of services for pilgrims, facilitate their trips and enrich their religious and cultural experiences, in line with the goals of Saudi Vision 2030. The training session was held on the sidelines of Al-Rabiah’s official visit to Malaysia, accompanied by a delegation from government agencies and the Saudi private sector. Further sessions will be organized in other countries before the start of this year’s Hajj season. The training program includes a detailed explanation of pilgrims’ trips and covers all aspects of performing Hajj and crowd management skills.
