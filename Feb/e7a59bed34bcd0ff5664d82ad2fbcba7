RIYADH: A Saudi delegation recently visited Iraq to promote the Ministry of Hajj and Umrahâ€™s newly launched Nusuk online platform for pilgrims. As part of a regional tour to highlight the service, the government party, headed by Minister of Hajj and Umrah Dr. Tawfiq Al-Rabiah, met Iraqi officials on the sidelines of a forum and accompanying exhibition to discuss cooperation initiatives. The meeting drew attention to the portal where pilgrims can access services such as the issue of visas and the provision of travel and accommodation packages. More than 25 partners representing travel, tourism, and pilgrimage companies from the Kingdom took part in the talks with their counterparts from Iraq. The forum followed previous meetings held by officials of the two countries at the Arar border crossing between Saudi Arabia and Iraq. The Kingdom recently announced a new transit visa enabling visitors traveling with Saudia or Flynas airlines to stay in the Kingdom for up to 96 hours and perform Umrah if booked through Nusuk. The ministry launched the platform in partnership with the Saudi Tourism Authority with the aim of enriching the experience of pilgrims visiting Saudi Arabia.
