NABLUS: US Special Representative Hady Amr has condemned “indiscriminate” violence by settlers and called for prosecutions as he visited a West Bank town where rampaging Israelis set ablaze dozens of cars and homes. Amr visited Hawara on Tuesday to express his deepest condolences to the family of a Palestinian killed in the attacks earlier this week, Palestine News and Info Agency reported. He condemned the “unacceptable wide scale, indiscriminate violence by settlers.” “We want to see full accountability and legal prosecution of those responsible for these heinous attacks and compensation for those who lost property or were otherwise affected,” said Amr after inspecting the damage done in the Palestinian town,” Amr added. Ned Price, a State Department spokesman, said on Monday that the US was “extremely concerned by the continuing violence in Israel and the West Bank. “It is imperative Israel and the Palestinians work together to de-escalate tensions and restore calm. Israelis and Palestinians deserve equally to live in safety and security.” He said that the US would “continue to work with Israelis and Palestinians and our regional partners towards restoring calm.” Fatah Deputy Chairman Mahmoud Aloul, who also went to Hawara with Amr, said Palestinians must be protected and the aggression of settlers must be brought to an end. “The main loss is the terror experienced by the people, especially women and children, as a result of the attacks carried out by the settlers, and the setting fire to their homes and properties, and this is an unprecedented psychological loss,” said Aloul. “We are counting on the role of the US administration to stop the violence in the region.” Mueen Dmeidi, the mayor of Hawara, called the attacks on his town unprecedented, adding that he believed they were carried out under the protection of the Israeli army.
