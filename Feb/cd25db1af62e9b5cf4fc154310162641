RIYADH: An ongoing Saudi program to clear landmines in Yemen saw 882 devices laid by the Iran-backed Houthis dismantled in the third week of February. Overseen by the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center, special teams destroyed five anti-personnel, 195 anti-tank mines, 681 unexploded ordinances and one explosive device. The KSRelief project is one of several initiatives undertaken by Saudi Arabia on the orders of King Salman to help the Yemeni people. It clear routes for much-needed humanitarian aid aimed at supporting the country’s citizens. The demining operations took place in Marib, Aden, Jouf, Shabwa, Taiz, Hodeidah, Lahij, Sanaa, Al-Bayda, Al-Dhale and Saada. A total of 388,433 mines have been cleared since the start of the project. More than 1.2 million mines have been planted by the Houthis, claiming the lives of hundreds of civilians. The Saudi project trains local demining engineers and provides them with modern equipment. It also offers support to Yemenis injured by the devices. In June 2022, the project’s contract was extended for another year at a cost of $33.29 million.
