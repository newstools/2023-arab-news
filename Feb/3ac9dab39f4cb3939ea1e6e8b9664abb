RIYADH: Unique challenges that startups in the Kingdom face when trying to secure funding will be the subject of a panel discussion on the final day of the LEAP 2023 conference on Thursday. “The Road to Success: The Journey of Saudi Pre-seeds Starting to Get Funded” will also explore the outlook for startups in Saudi Arabia over the next five years. Elina Idrisova, regional director of Digital Transformation, who will be part of the panel, told Arab News that the sessions will be about “how government is supporting these initiatives in order to accelerate the transformation and technology adoption.” Successful Saudi software startup Elevatus will be included in the discussion. Idrisova said that accelerators in Saudi Arabia are actively supporting and mentoring early-stage startups to help secure funding. The Kingdom is planning to invest more than $25 billion to expand the technology ecosystem, the regional director said. She said that the session will also discuss ways Saudi startups can attract global investors and scale worldwide. “I also want to highlight the exceptional support of accelerators and programs such as Venture Studios and different university research centers, which help startups to get more deep research and to understand the market well, to get to know how to conduct the right assessments and to create the product that’s really needed by the market,” she said.
