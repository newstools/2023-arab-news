KUWAIT: Kuwait has more organ donors per capita than any other country in the Arab region and the second most across the Middle East, a government official said.
Dr. Mustafa Al-Musawi, director of the organ provision unit at the Ministry of Health and head of the Kuwait Transplant Society, said that about 100 kidney transplants were carried out each year in the country.
“In 2022, the country witnessed around 50 kidney transplants sourced from 50 deceased individuals and 49 sourced from live patients,” he was quoted as saying by the Kuwait News Agency.
His comments were made during an event organized by the Kuwait Transplant Society to honor previous donors and encourage others to join the scheme.
The campaign hopes to boost the number of organ donors in the country to 30,000, from 17,000 at present.
While kidneys are the most commonly transplanted organs, Kuwait is making some inroads in the area of heart transplants.
