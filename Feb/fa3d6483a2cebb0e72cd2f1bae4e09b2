LONDON: UK actor and broadcaster Stephen Fry has been accused of making an Islamophobic remark at an event at Lord’s Cricket Ground in London, The Times reported on Monday. The 65-year-old, who is president of ground owners Marylebone Cricket Club, was said to have linked Muslims with terrorism in a joke at a cricketing dinner. One member, Chris Waterman, described the comment as “egregious” and deserving of disciplinary action. He said in opening remarks, Fry referred to the Allahakbarries cricket club, founded in 1890 by author J. M. Barrie. The name of the amateur team, which was active until 1913, was based on the mistaken interpretation that “Allahu akbar” meant “Heaven help us” in Arabic. Fry reportedly said: “The term ‘Allahu akbar,’ when used today, is usually followed by a loud bang.” However, other members said they had not heard the comment, with MCC CEO Guy Lavender describing Waterman’s account as “factually incorrect.” Lavender added: “The dinner in question was enjoyed by those that attended and we have not received any other complaint from attendees in this regard.”
