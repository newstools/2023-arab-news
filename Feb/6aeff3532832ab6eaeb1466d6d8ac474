JEDDAH: Organizers of the World Defense Show on Tuesday announced that the event would return to Riyadh for a “bigger, wider, and better” second run from Feb. 4 to 8 next year. Under the title “Equipped for Tomorrow,” the gathering will showcase the future of air, land, sea, space, and security defense technologies. The show, founded by the Saudi General Authority for Military Industries, is dedicated to creating a global business-to-business defense industry event. Andrew Pearcey, the show’s chief executive officer, said: “The incredible feedback we received from the industry, following the success of our first edition, has propelled us to continue growing and enhancing the offering of the show. “It is crucial that we work alongside all our partners to ensure we continue to evolve all areas of the show.” The inaugural event attracted 65,000 trade visitors, more than 600 exhibitors, and was held in 35,000 square meters of exhibition space. It offers the chance for participants to network, find new opportunities, and explore dynamic live demonstrations in an expanded venue for 2024. Hosting exhibitors from 45 countries, WDS 2024 will aim to provide a mega platform for the global defense industry, highlighting the future of defense, and contributing to a more inclusive, open, and collaborative sector. It will also offer a pathway for government entities and the private sector to work together toward localizing 50 percent of domestic defense equipment and services expenditure in the Kingdom, in line with Saudi Vision 2030 goals. With the participation of major global players, including defense giants Lockheed Martin, Boeing, General Dynamics, and John Cockerill Defense, the first show witnessed the signing of deals worth SR29.7 billion ($7.92 billion). The 2024 event will attract defense leaders who will address hot topics in the global industry, including sustainability, women in defense, and the development of young talents.
