LONDON: An appeal in the UK to raise funds for victims of the earthquakes that struck Turkiye and Syria received £60 million ($72.8 million) in three days, The Daily Mail reported on Monday. The appeal, launched by the Disasters Emergency Committee, supports 15 charities, and has the support of King Charles III and Camilla, queen consort, as well as the Prince and Princess of Wales, who said they were “horrified” by the “harrowing images” of the areas affected. DEC CEO Saleh Saeed said: “We’re incredibly grateful to the British public for their hugely generous response.” However, the UK government — which has also contributed £5 million to the fund — has faced criticism for failing to lift its sanctions on Syria, thereby creating difficulties in facilitating humanitarian aid deliveries, The Daily Mail reported. Andrew Mitchell, the UK’s development minister, told the BBC on Sunday that his country’s sanctions against Syria remain in place. He said that ministers would “do everything [they] can to make sure aid gets through to people who are suffering.” He added: “Specifically here, where sanctions would hold us back in any way, we would seek to have them lifted, but at the moment we are able to get what we want through.” The US announced on Saturday a 180-day exemption to its penalties on the war-torn country for “all transactions related to earthquake relief efforts.”
