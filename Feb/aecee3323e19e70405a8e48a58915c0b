ROME: Italy’s foreign minister said his country is “very worried” about the difficult economic and social situation in Tunisia, where there are shortages of food commodities and tensions between the government and trade unions.
Antonio Tajani also urged international institutions to provide Tunisia with financial support.
“There is great Italian concern about the social crisis in Tunisia. It is necessary to contribute to Tunisian stabilization and growth also with economic support,” he said after a telephone conversation with Kristalina Georgieva, director general of the International Monetary Fund. “Italy will continue to do its part,” Tajani pledged.
He raised the issue on Monday at the EU Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels. “In that country (Tunisia) the situation is complicated, and we must make sure that Europe is involved,” he said, calling for the subject to be “a fundamental point” on the council’s agenda.
During a phone call on Wednesday with Tunisian Foreign Minister Nabil Ammar, Tajani reaffirmed Italy’s willingness to keep supporting Tunisia economically and with international funders.
According to Italy’s Foreign Ministry, Tajani invited Ammar to visit Italy “in a bid to cement the tradition of consultation between the two countries.”
Ammar praised Tunisian-Italian relations and affirmed his willingness to further foster them in various fields.
