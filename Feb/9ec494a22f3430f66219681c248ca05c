A post shared by Berlinale (@berlinale) The rally took place following a panel discussion titled “The Role of Cinema and the Arts in the Iranian Revolution.” Panelists included Ebrahimi and Farsi, who expressed hope that the protests spreading across the country could help inspire change. “This regime lies,” Farahani said in her opening speech as quoted by Variety. “The prisons of Iran are full of innocent people. We need you to stand on the right side of history with the Iranian people. This regime will fall.” Meanwhile, protesters on the red carpet held demonstrations for women’s rights in Iran, climate change and fair wages for Berlin movie theater workers. “Whether you like it or not, this festival in particular, historically, is in a positive way, confrontational and political,” said Stewart at the opening press conference, according to The Hollywood Reporter.
