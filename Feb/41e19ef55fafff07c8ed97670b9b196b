LONDON: Reporters Without Borders has denounced threats from the Iranian regime that forced an independent news network to end its operations in the UK. The Persian-language satellite channel Iran International suspended its London bureau and moved its operation to the US after threats against its staff. Despite receiving armed police protection, the network also closed its television studio in the west of the British capital. “We condemn the ongoing threats against Iran International which have forced the channel to suspend its UK operations for safety,” said RSF UK Bureau Director Fiona O’Brien. “No journalist should face such risks in connection with their work, whether in Iran, the UK, or anywhere else. “We call on the Iranian authorities to immediately cease efforts to silence independent reporting, and urge the UK government to do its utmost to ensure journalists can safely do their jobs.” London’s Metropolitan Police advised the channel to relocate after an Austrian national was charged on Feb. 13 with “collecting information of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism,” according to the Metropolitan Police. Last October, RSF denounced Tehran’s sanctions against UK-based international news outlets, including Iran International TV and BBC Persian. Iranian journalists working in Turkey for Iran International TV have also reported being threatened.
