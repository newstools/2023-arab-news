London: A British Army soldier has been charged with terror offenses after allegedly carrying out a bomb hoax at a Royal Air Force base earlier this year, The Times reported. Daniel Abed Khalife, 21, is also accused of attempting to gain “useful” information about armed forces staff at the UK base. On Jan. 2 this year, Khalife allegedly placed three canisters and wiring at RAF Stafford “with the intention of inducing in another a belief that the said item was likely to explode or ignite.” Violating section 58A of the UK’s Terrorism Act 2000 can result in up to 15 years’ imprisonment, with bomb hoaxes carrying six-month sentences and small fines. At Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Wednesday, Khalife only spoke to confirm his name and date of birth. He was remanded into custody and is set to appear at the Old Bailey later this month. Chief Magistrate Paul Goldspring told Khalife: “You did not enter a plea. These matters are very serious. “If you are convicted you are going to face a prison sentence in years, not months. Therefore, this court’s powers are insufficient.”
