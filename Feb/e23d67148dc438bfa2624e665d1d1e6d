LONDON: London firefighters have rescued a mother who was trapped under a collapsed building in Turkiye for four days and reunited her with her new-born daughter. Footage circulating on social media captured the moment when Dom Mabbett and his team from Edmonton fire station pulled the woman from a tiny gap within a mountain of debris, before leading her to her child who was waiting on a nearby street. Mabbett is just one of the 77 members of the UK’s Fire & Rescue Service’s International Search & Rescue team dispatched to Turkiye following Monday’s earthquakes. Responding to the footage, London Fire Brigade tweeted: “This is the incredible moment our ISAR team helped reunite a mother and daughter four days after the Turkey earthquake struck.”  This is the incredible moment our @UKISAR team helped reunite a mother & daughter four days after the #TurkeyEarthquake struck.

Serap Topal, 33, who sustained crush injuries, and her son Mehmet were trapped for three days after their home in Kahramanmaras — one of the cities closest to the epicenter — collapsed before their rescue.
