DUBAI: OSN+ has launched a new activation at Riyadh Front in Saudi Arabia, enabling guests to experience the platform’s most popular shows. The immersive experience from Feb. 15 -21 will include shows such as “White Lotus,” “Yellowstone,” “House of the Dragon” and “The Last of Us.” The futuristic 10 x 10-meter installation will allow guests to experience each show through different zones. The first zone will welcome guests at the reception of the “White Lotus” hotel, after which they can visit the Dutton ranch from “Yellowstone” to try the show’s branding ritual. Guests can then make their way through the dragon den from “House of the Dragon,” ending their journey in the post-apocalyptic world from “The Last of Us.” The free activation will be open from 4 p.m. until midnight and is part of Riyadh Season, an annual entertainment and sports festival, part of the larger Saudi Seasons initiative held from October to March in Riyadh.
