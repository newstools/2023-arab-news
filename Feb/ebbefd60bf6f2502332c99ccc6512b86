LONDON: Twitter is facing restrictions in Turkiye as the country struggles to deal with the aftermath of the devastating earthquake, sources reported. Independent global internet monitor NetBlocks confirmed that the social media platform has been restricted on multiple network providers, including TTNet and Turkcell, on Wednesday. “Real-time network data show Twitter has been restricted in Turkiye,” Netblocks said in a tweet. “The filtering is applied on major internet providers and comes as the public come to rely on the service in the aftermath of a series of deadly earthquakes.” Twitter is widely adopted in the country and its restriction disrupts critical communication for rescue efforts. NetBlocks Director Alp Toker said that this is the first time the company detected social media restrictions during a natural disaster. “Twitter has been in use extensively in the aftermath of the earthquakes, both to seek assistance and rescue equipment and by those trying to get back in touch with loved ones,” Toker said. Turkish authorities have not given any formal explanations, but NetBlocks said that Turkiye often acts to prevent alleged disinformation during national emergencies. In November, following a terrorist attack in central Istanbul that killed six people and injured more than 80, authorities imposed a 10-hour social media ban. Some users also reported that TikTok might have been affected by the restrictions. In a statement, the video-sharing app said it was aware of the technical difficulties and is “investigating the matter and hope access is restored as soon as possible as platforms like TikTok remain a critical way to stay in touch during crises.” NetBlocks and some Twitter users have reported that users in Turkiye can still access the platforms through VPNs.
