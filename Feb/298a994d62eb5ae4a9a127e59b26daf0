RIYADH: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited a team of Saudi volunteers aiding people impacted by the devastating earthquake in Antakya, state news agency (SPA) reported.
Saudi Arabia’s King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center (KSRelief) had set up air bridges, dispatching several relief planes and rescue teams to quake-hit Turkiye.
The historic Turkish city of Antakya in southern Hatay province was among the places worst hit by the earthquakes that struck the country and Syria earlier this month, killing more than 46,000 and displacing thousands more.
The death toll was expected to increase after another 6.3 magnitude earthquake hit Turkiye on Monday night.  
During his visit, the Turkish president thanked Saudi Arabia for the support provided to the people of Turkiye,  according to SPA.
In a statement, KSRelief said the Kingdom had provided “all necessary humanitarian assistance to alleviate the suffering of the affected.”
