BEIRUT: The US military said Friday a helicopter raid led by its forces in northeast Syria left a senior leader with the Daesh group dead and four American service members wounded.
The military added in the short statement that the operation was conducted Thursday night in partnership with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces which is allied with the US
It added that “an explosion on target resulted in four US service members and one working dog wounded.” It did not say in which part of northeast Syria the raid was conducted.
It identified the killed Daesh commander as Hamza Al-Homsi.
Despite their defeat in Syria in March 2019, Daesh sleeper cells still conduct attacks around Syria and Iraq where they once declared a “caliphate.”
Joint operations between the US military and SDF fighters are common in northeast and eastern Syria along the border with Iraq.
The statement said the service members and working dog are receiving treatment in a US medical facility in neighboring Iraq.
The US military killed two Daesh leaders in Syria over the past few years.
In February 2021, Abu Ibrahim Al-Hashimi Al-Qurayshi, was killed in a US raid in northwest Syria. Daesh founder Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi was hunted down by the Americans in a raid in October 2019.
In October, the leader of Daesh, Abu Al-Hassan Al-Hashimi Al-Qurayshi, was killed in battle with Syrian rebels in southern Syria.
