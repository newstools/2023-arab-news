KUWAIT: The Kuwait Red Crescent Society on Friday finalized a $5m international cooperation deal to help Syrian victims of the devastating earthquake in southern Turkiye this week that also hit parts of northern Syria.
The deal was reached with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and the Qatar Red Crescent Society, KRCS chairman Hilal Al-Sayer told the Kuwait News Agency.
Food, medical assistance and tools for building shelters are essential elements of the agreement, he said, to help provide urgent humanitarian aid to those affected by the earthquake. He added that the deal reflects his organization’s commitment to the directives of Sheikh Nawaf Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, Kuwait’s emir, who had called for immediate assistance to victims of the quake. So far, KRCS has sent 90 tons of aid, officials said.
