RIYADH: Saudi Arabian Military Industries will develop an industrial complex for ground systems in Riyadh following an announcement at the International Defense Conference in Abu Dhabi, the Saudi Press Agency reported on Monday. The complex will manufacture armored vehicles and help in integrating advanced ground systems and logistical support, along with playing its part in the testing and maintenance of related services. SAMI signed an agreement on the sidelines of the conference with Ghafari Associates, a global architecture, engineering, and consulting firm, to design the complex. SAMI CEO Walid Abu Khaled said that the agreement would expand the horizons of international cooperation with major regional and international companies, and reflected the Kingdomâ€™s unwavering support for the defense and security sector. The move is in line with the objectives of Saudi Vision 2030 to localize more than 50 percent of military equipment spending, transfer knowledge and technology, and build national expertise in the fields of manufacturing, maintenance, repair, research, and development.
