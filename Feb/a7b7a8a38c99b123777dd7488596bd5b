RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s King Salman said on Wednesday that the Kingdom commemorated the anniversary of Founding Day with pride. “In the Kingdom, we remember with pride the anniversary of Founding Day, which expresses about three centuries of the establishment of the essence of this blessed state in 1727 A.D. (1139 AH), during which we experienced various challenges and overcame all crises,” he said on Twitter. “Cohesion and stability was the basis that embodied the deep-rootedness of this country, land and people.” King Salman issued a royal decree in January last year that the founding of the country would be commemorated annually on Feb. 22. The day celebrates Saudi Arabia’s deep historical, civilizational and cultural roots, and marks the establishment of the First Saudi State by Imam Mohammed bin Saud in 1727.
