SHARJAH: The Environment and Protected Areas Authority on Friday celebrated the first anniversary of the opening of the world’s largest safari park outside Africa, the Sharjah Safari project.
Opened by Sheikh Dr. Sultan bin Muhammad Al Qasimi, Sharjah’s ruler, 12 months ago, the location has enhanced the visitor experience to the UAE and established its position as a leading destination for nature and wildlife tourism.
The attraction has boosted travel, ecotourism, hospitality and entertainment in the region, reported the Emirates News Agency.
The project has hosted a wide range of international conferences and events, and attracted hundreds of thousands of both local and international visitors.
Hana Saif Al Suwaidi, EPAA’s chairperson, told of her great pride in the pioneering world tourism and environmental project.
She said: “Dr. Sheikh Sultan personally supervised the implementation of this vital and qualitative scientific project and is keen to continue its development to achieve the desired goals.”
She added that more than 600,000 visitors had been to the park since its opening, its guests enjoying 12 different safari environments inspired by Africa.
Sharjah Safari Park boasts more than 50,000 animals from 120 species, and Al Suwaidi said that the location had planted more than 100,000 trees.
She added that last November a rare scimitar oryx was born there, a species that was declared extinct in the wild in 2000.
She said: “Due to its picturesque environmental and natural location, the project has hosted many important events, including the 22nd Sharjah International Conservation Forum for Arabia’s Biodiversity.”
It has also hosted a metaverse media workshop, organized by the Sharjah Media Council, and the Sharjah International Cycling Tour.
In addition, a team of photographers participating in the International Photography Festival visited the park to capture images of its natural environment and gardens.
