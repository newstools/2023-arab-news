ISLAMABAD: Former Pakistani president and army chief Pervez Musharraf has passed away in Dubai, local media reported on Sunday, with the Pakistani services chiefs expressing heartfelt condolences over his demise. Musharraf, who aged 79, was fighting a rare disease, amyloidosis, and was under treatment at a hospital in Dubai, Pakistani media reported. The three Pakistani services chiefs and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff committee expressed their heartfelt condolences on his sad demise. “CJCSC & Services Chiefs express heartfelt condolences on sad demise of General Pervez Musharaf, Former President, CJCSC and Chief of Army Staff,” the Pakistani military said in a statement. “May Allah bless the departed soul and give strength to bereaved family.” Musharraf seized power in 1999 in a bloodless coup after then-prime minister Nawaz Sharif tried to dismiss him as army chief, having appointed him above more senior officers a year earlier. His plan to return to power in 2013 was dashed when he was disqualified from running in an election won by Nawaz Sharif — the man he deposed in 1999. In 2016, a travel ban was lifted and Musharraf traveled to Dubai to seek medical treatment. Three years later, he was sentenced to death in absentia for treason, related to his 2007 decision to impose emergency rule. However, a court later nullified the ruling. Musharraf, who ruled Pakistan as a “chief executive” when the 9/11 attacks on the United States (US) took place, swiftly aligned with Washington during its military intervention in neighboring Afghanistan. In more than seven years in office, he oversaw a stint of economic growth while dodging at least three assassination attempts. Musharraf won a five-year term as president in a 2002 referendum, but reneged on promises to quit as army chief until late 2007.
