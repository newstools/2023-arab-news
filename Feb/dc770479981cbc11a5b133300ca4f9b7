A post shared by Middle East Film & Comic Con (@mefcc) In a recent interview with Discussing Film, the actor said that he’s ready to say goodbye to “Stranger Things,” which will wrap up after its fifth and final season. “What’s funny is when I started the show, I never, ever wanted it to end,” Harbour said. “That’s why I love the show. I think it’s a great show, even if I wasn’t in it. Now we’re almost nine years from filming the first season, and I think it is time for it to end. But it is, of course, very bittersweet. You know, there’s a sadness there. But also, we’ve all grown up.”  A post shared by David Harbour (@dkharbour) Harbour, who has seen his star rise significantly since landing the role of Hopper, recently appeared in the holiday-themed movie “Violent Night” and stars in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film “Thunderbolts,” set for release in summer 2024. Other celebrities attending MEFCC include “Stranger Things” cast member Jamie Campbell Bower, “Moon Knight” actress May Calamawy, Hollywood star Andy Serkis, “House of the Dragon” and “Doctor Who” star Matt Smith, and “Star Wars” veteran Anthony Daniels.
