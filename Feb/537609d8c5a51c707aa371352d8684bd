DUBAI: Actor Alec Baldwin entered a not guilty plea on Thursday to a charge of involuntary manslaughter stemming from a fatal shooting on the New Mexico set of the film “Rust,” court documents show.
Baldwin made the plea while exercising his right to waive a first court appearance that was set for Friday.
Baldwin, who is expected to make his initial appearance before a judge on Friday, entered the plea via a court filing.
New Mexico First Judicial District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies charged Baldwin and the movie’s set armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, with two counts of involuntary manslaughter last month for the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.
Gutierrez-Reed will make a first court appearance on Friday via video link, her lawyer Jason Bowles said.
First assistant director Dave Halls also plead not guilty in a Thursday court filing in which he also waived a first court appearance.
