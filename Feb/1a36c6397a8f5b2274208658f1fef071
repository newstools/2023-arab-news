RIYADH: The Saudi Cabinet on Tuesday affirmed the Kingdom’s support for the Iraqi government’s efforts to achieve sustainable growth and prosperity for its people. At the start of the session, chaired by King Salman at Irqah Palace in Riyadh, ministers were briefed on the recent talks between Saudi Arabia and several other countries. These were held to ensure regional and global development, cooperation and stability. Minister of State and Acting Minister of Media Issam bin Saad bin Saeed said that the Cabinet addressed several reports on regional and international conferences hosted by Saudi Arabia during the week. He said these events were held to secure partnerships and investment that would further boost the nation’s leadership role on the global stage. The Cabinet also welcomed the election of Saudi Arabia as chair of the executive council of the Digital Cooperation Organization, a post it will hold until 2030. This highlights the Kingdom’s pioneering role in technology and the digital economy, and would assist in building mutually beneficial relations and pacts with member states that would ensure a promising digital future for everyone. The Cabinet also discussed the latest regional and international developments, and stressed that Saudi Arabia supports those nations affected by Monday’s earthquakes, which resulted in deaths, injuries and missing people.
