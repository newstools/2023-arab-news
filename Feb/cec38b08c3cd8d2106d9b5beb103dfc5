RIYADH: A team of surgeons in Riyadh successfully separated conjoined twin boys from Yemen on Thursday, the Saudi Press Agency reported. Salman and Abdullah were born joined at the pelvis and abdomen. They shared a bladder and colon, and had a sphincter defect and atrophy of the lower abdominal wall. Following directives from King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the operation to separate them was carried out at King Abdullah Specialist Children’s Hospital in Riyadh. It was funded by the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center, also known as KSrelief. A team of 35 doctors, specialists and nurses performed the delicate surgical procedures in six stages during an operation that took eight hours. The parents of the twins gave their heartfelt thanks to the Saudi leadership and medical team for helping their sons, and expressed their gratitude for the warm hospitality they received from everyone involved in caring for the boys. KSrelief’s Conjoined Twins Program has so far sponsored 55 separation operations for children from 23 countries. The Kingdom covers all costs for treatment and care, transportation, and accommodation for the patients and their families.
