FRISCO, Texas: Alex Morgan and Mallory Swanson scored and the US defeated Brazil 2-1 on Wednesday night to win the SheBelieves Cup for the fourth straight year. Japan, who defeated Canada 3-0 in the earlier match at Toyota Stadium, were runners-up in the four-team, round-robin tournament. All four SheBelieves Cup teams will play in Women’s World Cup this summer in Australia and New Zealand. Morgan’s curling goal sailed out of reach of Brazilian goalkeeper Lorena. Morgan now has five goals all-time in SheBelieves matches. It was Morgan’s 14th goal since the birth of her daughter in 2020, giving her the national team record for most goals as a mom. Swanson scored in the 63rd minute, her fourth goal of the tournament and seventh overall goal this year, matching her total of all of last year. Swanson, formerly Mallory Pugh, married Chicago Cubs shortstop Dansby Swanson in December. Ludmila scored in stoppage time for Brazil to avoid the shutout. It was the first goal the US have allowed this year. The US are undefeated in five overall matches. Midfielder Rose Lavelle started for the US after missing the first two matches of the tournament with a minor injury. Japan snapped a four-game losing streak with their win over Canada. Japan had not scored in four straight matches, including two SheBelieves games, until Kiko Seike put her team in front with a goal in the 26th minute. The Canadian players, in the midst of a labor dispute with their federation, again wore purple T-shirts reading “Enough is Enough” for the anthems and they wore purple wristbands during the match. Players for the US also wore purple wristbands in solidarity with Canada. The SheBelieves Cup started in 2016. The US have won six of the eight tournaments.
