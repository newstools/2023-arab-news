In a statement to the stock exchange, the group said that its operating expenses increased 16.6 percent to SR644.3 million in 2022 due to a rise in salaries and related benefits.

The company reported a 337 percent surge in 2022 net profit after zakat and tax of SR75.2 million from SR17.2 million in 2021. The profit spike was spurred by an increase in the number of patients in outpatient and inpatient clinics, higher revenue due to the revised prices with major customers, accreditation and case mix, and better efficiency due to the ramp-up of new facilities. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the healthcare services provider achieved a net profit of SR33.2 million against a net loss of SR18.39 million in the year-ago period.

The profit decline is attributed to a slight decrease in sales and an increase in the cost of production inputs, affecting profit margins. The company reported an 11 percent decline in net profit to SR41.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 from SR47.1 million in the year-ago period. Its share price fell 2 percent to SR29.35.
