RIYADH: The Saudi Cup kicked off with jockeys from around the world competing for a total prize pool of $35.3 million. The Saudi Cup took place on Friday and Saturday at the King Abdulaziz Racetrack in Riyadh, with the event hosted by the Jockey Club of Saudi Arabia and organized by the Horse Racing Club. It showcased the Kingdom’s culture through entertainment, folklore performances, and activities for all, including an outdoor area for children. Attractions included Sara Shakeel’s project “Oasis,” where fantasy met reality. In “Saudi House,” visitors were able to learn about Najdi architecture through an interactive experience moving from one room to another after solving various puzzles. Another attraction, the Saudi 100 Brands Exhibition, offered a fashion tour featuring unique pieces and designs by local designers reflecting Saudi culture. Cultural Corridor took visitors through scenes reflecting the cultural diversity and richness of the Kingdom. Tony Kelly from the UK said that the races were “amazing.” “What has been achieved in a short space of time is incredible, and the race itself is making waves on a global stage. So it’s exciting to see how big the race day can become,” he said. Deborah O’Dell from Florida said that although the Saudi Cup bears similarities with the Kentucky Derby, “(this) is more fun. There are multiple races, you can get up close and see the horses, and you get to see the Saudi culture at the same time.” Restaurants catered to visitors’ tastes, with one offering dishes prepared by Saudi chef Rakan Al-Oraifi and inspired by various regions of the Kingdom. Many concerts were held during the weekend. The Mayyas put on a show inspired by Saudi culture, with an orchestral performance from a modern symphony that blended classic international melodies with authentic Saudi melodies. DJ Bedouin is scheduled to close the Saudi Cup weekend.
