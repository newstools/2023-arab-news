DUBAI: Netflix on Tuesday dropped subscription prices across select countries in the Middle East. In Yemen, Iraq, Tunisia, Jordan, Palestine, Libya, Algeria, Lebanon, Iran, and Sudan, the streaming service’s basic plan will now cost $3.99 instead of $7.99, its standard plan $7.99 instead of $9.99, and premium plan down from $11.99 to $9.99. In Egypt, the basic plan has been slashed from 100 Egyptian pounds ($3.27) to 50, standard from 165 to 100 pounds, with the premium cut from 200 pounds to 150. In Morocco, the basic plan has changed from 65 Moroccan dirhams ($6.28) to 35, standard from 95 to 65 dirhams, and premium from 125 to 95 dirhams. There is no change in the cost of subscription plans in Gulf countries such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE. New subscribers will see the reduced price immediately upon sign-up effective from Feb. 21, while existing subscribers will see the update roll out over the coming weeks and come into effect from the next billing cycle. However, Netflix’s website said company plans and prices may change as it “continues to add more TV shows and movies and introduce new product features.” Last year, Netflix launched its cheaper ad-supported basic plan in select markets. In the US, for example, the basic with ads plan costs $6.99, while the basic (without ads) plan costs $9.99. In the Middle East, there is no indication that the lower cost of the plans is related to ads.
