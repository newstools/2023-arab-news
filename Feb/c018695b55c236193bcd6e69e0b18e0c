RIYADH: Search and rescue teams from Saudi Civil Defense have completed their operations in Turkiye following the 6.4 magnitude earthquake on Monday, the Saudi Press Agency has reported. The organization met the International Search and Rescue Advisory Group, Turkiye’s Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency, and other local authorities to coordinate its efforts. It carried out search and rescue missions in 47 locations across the cities of Gaziantep, Antakya, and Kahramanmaras, using cutting-edge technology and equipment. The Saudi Civil Defense team returned to Riyadh on Thursday, although the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center is still providing help in Turkiye and Syria. The number of people killed in Turkiye in this month’s devastating earthquakes has risen to 43,556, the country’s Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said. The combined death toll in Turkiye and Syria now stands at 47,244. Soylu told state broadcaster TRT Haber that there had been 7,930 aftershocks following the first earthquake on Feb. 6 and that more than 600,000 apartments and 150,000 commercial premises had suffered at least moderate damage.
