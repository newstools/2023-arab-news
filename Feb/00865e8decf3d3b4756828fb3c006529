RIYADH: Portuguese superstar Cristiano Ronaldo celebrated Founding Day wearing traditional Saudi attire with his Al-Nassr teammates on Wednesday. Appearing in a video posted by Al-Nassr FC’s official Twitter account, the footballer was seen drinking Saudi coffee, a hospitality staple in the Kingdom, while wearing a crisp white Saudi thobe.   He was also seen later in the day wearing a dashing navy blue and gold-printed daglah over the thobe.   The thobe is a full-length, typically long-sleeved, gown-like garment worn by men in Saudi Arabia and is considered national dress. Ronaldo and his teammates were seen enjoying a traditional Ardah performance with swords and singing, and the superstar was also spotted dancing with the Saudi flag draped around his shoulders.   Last week, Ronaldo’s mother, Maria Dolores dos Santos Aveiro, posted a picture of herself on Instagram with her grandson, Cristiano Jr., who was wearing a thobe. The image delighted Ronaldo’s Saudi fans. Founding Day is celebrated in the Kingdom on Feb. 22.
