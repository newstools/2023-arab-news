RIYADH: The second day of the Riyadh International Humanitarian Forum kicked off on Tuesday with a focus on enhancing global aid efforts and finding innovative practical solutions to the challenges that face humanitarian work. The third edition of the forum, which is organized by the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center, brings a group of international organizations and institutions working in the humanitarian and development fields together in the Saudi capital Riyadh. British Minister of State Andrew Mitchell said Tuesday that the “global needs are at a record high, and there is a growing gap between these needs and funding.” The two-day forum will hold case study presentations by researchers from regions affected by humanitarian crises. On the sidelines of the forum, Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan met with the UN high commissioner for refugees and the director general of the International Organization for Migration.
