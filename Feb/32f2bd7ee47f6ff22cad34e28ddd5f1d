RIYADH: Saudi Minister of Transport and Logistics Saleh bin Nasser Al-Jasser launched an electronic portal on Sunday that will facilitate the entry and movement of tourist yachts in the Kingdom, the Saudi Press Agency reported. The “Ebhar” platform unifies all government procedures and information from 20 government agencies, including yacht registration services, procedures for entering and leaving the Kingdom, sailing permits, issuing navigational licenses, and registering yachts under the Saudi flag. During the launch ceremony, which was held at the Jeddah Yacht Club, Al-Jasser said that Saudi Arabia was experiencing a significant expansion of its coastal and marine assets, including the development of new destinations such as NEOM, Amala, and the Red Sea project. He also noted the yacht market’s bright future, which is expected to grow 19.4 percent a year from 2022 to 2028.
