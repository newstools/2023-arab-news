DUBAI: Starzplay has partnered with Zain Kuwait as the telecommunications provider’s commercial and retail distributor in Kuwait. As part of the deal, Zain Kuwait will make Starzplay and the platform’s sports package available to customers with the new Max plans available through mobile and home internet packages. The platform has already partnered with Zain in other markets such as Saudi Arabia. The new deal comes as Starzplay looks to strengthen its “geographical expansion across the MENA region,” said Raghida Abou Fadel, senior vice president for business development and sales. “Kuwait is an important market for our business, and we want to extend further to offer Starzplay’s diverse entertainment and sports portfolio to fans in the market,” she added.
