In Oman, Salhab posted four consistent rounds of 77, 73, 78 and 72 to finish on 12 over at Al Mouj Golf in Muscat. His standout round was a level par 72 on closing day, and he collected $4,400 for his efforts.

At Golf Saudi, we are delighted that Faisal managed to make the cut so early in his professional career. This confirms the great progress he made as an amateur in the Saudi National Team in recent years and we expect him to achieve great things in future in a professional capacity. “Alongside fellow compatriot professionals, Othman Almulla and Saud Alsharif, Salhab continues to be supported by both the Saudi Golf Federation and Golf Saudi, serving as a role model for those across Saudi Arabia who want to get into golf.” After a successful amateur career, which saw Salhab win two events during 2021 in the MENA region, including the PIF Saudi Open, he took the decision to make the jump to the pro game alongside countryman Alsharif earlier this month at Royal Greens. Going forward, Salhab will enjoy a full schedule of events on the Asian Tour, competing in the International Series Qatar this weekend, before venturing further east to the International Series in Thailand.
