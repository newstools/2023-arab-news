TOKYO: Essam Bukhary, CEO of Manga Productions in Saudi Arabia, says that “anime and manga are important to strengthen creativity and imagination,” and he believes it also contributed to the great success of Japan after the war. In an interview with Kyodo News Agency, he set his goal as “to inspire and nurture young talent in his own country.” Bukhary grew up in his native country watching Japanese anime. This led to an intense interest in the culture, language and economy of Japan. He taught himself the Japanese language by watching the anime, “The Rose of Versailles.” Bukhari first came to Japan in 1986 where his interest in the anime and games culture as well as a keen interest in the country’s economic success increased. Following his graduation from Waseda University in Tokyo, he worked as a cultural and educational officer at the Saudi Embassy in Japan for seven years. He now produces anime and manga in Saudi Arabia. Since 2017, Bukhary has worked with Manga Productions, and other Japanese anime companies. In 2021, a collaboration with Toei Animation Company won a prize at the International Film Awards for the feature-length animated film, “Journey – The Story of Miracles and Battles on the Old Arabian Peninsula.” Bukhary also serves as editor-in-chief of the monthly magazine Manga Arabia Kids, first published in 2021 and distributed free of charge to elementary and junior high schools in Saudi Arabia.
