DUBAI: Dubai has launched a campaign to get social media stars to highlight the emirate’s cultural landmarks and events in a push to promote this year’s Art Season.
Organizers say the campaign, #DubaiDestinations, will bring together the emirate’s influencers, photographers, animators, and videographers to develop content focused on the events.
This year’s season, subtitled “Take a Walk on the Art Side,” runs until March 20 and celebrates Dubai’s global cultural stature as well as its diverse artistic and musical offerings.
Events include the Sikka art and design festival, Art Dubai, Dubai Opera performances and DIFC Art Nights.
Hala Badri, the director general of Dubai’s Culture and Arts Authority, told the Emirates News Agency that she wanted to get creators engaged with the festival, while Shaima Al-Suwaidi, the director of the governmental body Brand Dubai, said her team would work content creators and influencers to get the events more widely known.
Dubai Media Council Managing Director Mona Al-Marri said that the #DubaiDestinations campaign would also promote the emirate’s major events held throughout the year, including economic, cultural, sports, and other global events.
