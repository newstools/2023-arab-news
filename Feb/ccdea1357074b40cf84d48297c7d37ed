Vargas chases the 130-pound throne at the Alamodome in San Antonio, the same Texas venue where he captured the WBC featherweight title last July in a 12-round split decision over previously unbeaten Filipino Mark Magsayo.
“The Alamodome has seen me crowned champion before and they’re going to see it again on Saturday,” Vargas said Thursday. “It’s a big goal of mine to become part of the club of three-division champions.”
Vargas, 36-0 with 22 knockouts, owned the WBC super bantamweight title from 2017 to 2019.
“The best way to tell the world about me is by winning another world title,” Vargas said. “I’ve been a solid world champion for a while and now I’m going to add myself to the same list as the greatest Mexican fighters of all time.” For the latest updates, follow us on Twitter @ArabNewsSport @reyvargasbox #boxing #boxeo #boxingactive #boxingtraining #ReyVargas pic.twitter.com/ODMw8p2SLw — Boxing Active (@boxingactive) February 8, 2023 Other Mexican greats with world titles in three weight classes include Julio Cesar Chavez, Erik Morales and Marco Antonio Barrera.
Home-state hopeful Foster, 19-2 with 11 knockouts, has won nine fights in a row to earn his first world title bout.
“I’m coming to spoil the show,” Foster said. “I know he’s going to have the fans on his side but by the end of the night the world is going to see what I’m really made of.
“This means the world to me.”
