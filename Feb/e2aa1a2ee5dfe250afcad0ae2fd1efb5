RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Tuesday directed the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center to operate an air bridge to help earthquake victims in Syria and Turkiye. A magnitude 7.8 quake hit Turkiye and neighboring Syria early on Monday, toppling thousands of buildings including many apartment blocks, wrecking hospitals, and leaving tens of thousands of people injured or homeless. The bridge will help provide health, shelter, food, and logistical assistance to mitigate the effects of the earthquake on people in Syria and Turkiye. The king and crown prince also ordered the organisation of a charity campaign through KSrelief’s Sahem Platform. The assistance provided stems from the keenness of the Saudi leadership to support those affected by the devastating earthquake in Syria and Turkiye, the Supervisor General of KSrelief Dr. Abdullah Al-Rabeeah said. He added that various food, shelter, and medical aid will be provided in support of rescue efforts. Search teams and aid poured into both Turkiye and Syria on Tuesday as rescuers working in freezing temperatures dug through the remains of buildings flattened by a powerful earthquake. The death toll soared above 6,200 and is still expected to rise.
