Oliver Skipp and Harry Kane scored to pile the misery on Chelsea manager Graham Potter, whose team cannot seem to turn their form around.
Fourth-placed Spurs, meanwhile, strengthened their bid for a Champions League qualifying spot by moving four points clear of Newcastle, having played two games more.
But Chelsea’s campaign just keeps on getting worse after extending their winless run to six games.
Potter’s team has only won once in their last 11 games and twice in the Premier League since mid-October.
While Potter is said to enjoy the faith of the club’s owners Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital, the latest loss will increase the pressure on him.
Chelsea went down to second-half goals from Skipp and Kane after rarely threatening Spurs at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.
Chelsea looked bereft of attacking ideas and have now scored just a single goal in their last six matches in all competitions.
Tottenham took the lead in the first minute of the second half through Skipp, and Kane swept in another in the 82nd. For the latest updates, follow us on Twitter @ArabNewsSport
