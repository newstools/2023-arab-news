ABU DHABI: A group of researchers led by a professor at NYU Abu Dhabi has developed a non-invasive system to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal motility disorders. Researchers have produced 3D magnetic field gradients using high-frequency electromagnetic coils to track the movement of an ingestible smart pill through the gastrointestinal tract, NYUAD said on Tuesday. The ingestible wireless device measures and transmits the field magnitude to determine its precise location, which is then sent to a smartphone via Bluetooth technology. It reportedly allows for a more accurate evaluation of the movement of food from the mouth through the throat, esophagus, stomach, intestines and out of the body. The system has been modeled using the digestive systems of large animals. Existing smart pills do not offer the large field-of-view, high spatial resolution and fully wireless operation that the 3D magnetic field gradient developed by the researchers allows for, WAM reported. “The smart pill our team has developed represents a more accessible and efficient approach to assessing GI motility that can benefit both patients and medical providers,” Khalil Ramadi, NYUAD assistant professor of bioengineering, said. “This is a new frontier for medical diagnosis and evidence-based treatment and has the potential, with further research and refinement, to revolutionize how we can most effectively address health challenges that impact millions of people worldwide,” Ramadi added. It is estimated that more than one-third of the world’s population suffers from gastrointestinal disorders.
