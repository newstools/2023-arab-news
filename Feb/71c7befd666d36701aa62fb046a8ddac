DUBAI: Volkswagen Middle East has launched its new campaign titled “Made for Life,” featuring the automobile brand’s fleet of cars through the lens of local photographers. The new campaign is an extension of Volkswagen’s “Made for Families” campaign as the brand aims to expand its target audience beyond families to couples and single audiences. “As a people-focused brand, one of our main goals is to create content that resonates with our audience and to showcase the work of regional talent,” said Anja Petrovski, marketing director of Volkswagen Middle East. Volkswagen teamed up with photographers from Saudi Arabia and the UAE to shoot pictures of its fleet of cars, which will be used across the brand’s various marketing channels. “Through commissioning up-and-coming regional photographers to capture our line-up through their lens, we developed a series of authentic, humanized, vibrant and simulating images underpinning the message that Volkswagen is truly ‘Made for Life’.” The first phase of the campaign features seven photographers: Ali Murad, Nino Consorte, Ushma Dhakan, Norah Alamri, Sami Altokhais, and Omar Shaheen. “The campaign highlights our commitment to supporting working creatives in the region while having our audience at our core,” Petrovski added.
