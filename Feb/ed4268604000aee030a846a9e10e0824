A post shared by LUXURY (@luxuryexplained) Visitors will be able to learn more about the Dubai guide that retails for around $46. For the past 20 years, the Louis Vuitton City Guide series has explored 30 of the world’s metropolises, with an offbeat look at local fashion, design, contemporary art, food and culture. Each volume invites writers and guests from diverse backgrounds to provide a subjective view of the most beautiful hotels, the best restaurants, the quirkiest shops and the most famous historic places.   “Dubai is now a superlative city focused on the future, being designed and built at a frenetic pace,” reads a statement on the brand’s website. “From gravity-defying towers and fountains with spectacular Wagnerian displays to hidden corners and places off the beaten track, the city is constantly on the move.” “Galvanized with energy, Dubai relishes seemingly impossible challenges, like creating a huge sail on an artificial island – the Burj Al Arab, rapidly becoming the country’s emblem,” added the statement. The guide is also available online and in bookstores worldwide, with a version available on the City Guides App on Apple.
