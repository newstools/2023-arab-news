DUBAI: An Emirati rescue team have pulled a Syrian family of four from under the rubble of their home in Turkiye after two devastating earthquakes killed more than 16,000 people. The mother and her children, who lived in Kahramanmaras province, the closest city to the quake’s epicenter, were rescued in an operation that lasted more than five hours, Emirates News Agency (WAM) reported. They received immediate healthcare before being transferred to the hospital for further treatment.    The rescue was part of the “Gallant Knight/2” operation that the UAE launched earlier this week to aid those impacted by the earthquakes in southern Turkiye and Syria. Earlier, the UAE pledged $100 million aid to the two impacted countries, sending relief flights to help with the search and rescue operations and supply urgent aid to those in need. The UAE rescue teams on Wednesday also evacuated three injured Emirati citizens from quake-hit Turkiye. The operation was carried out in coordination with the UAE’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation and the Ministry of Defense.   Countries around the world have rushed to send aid and rescue workers to save people impacted by the earthquakes, which flattened thousands of buildings and left thousands homeless. Rescue operations continue as hope started to fade in finding more survivors amid freezing winter temperatures.
