AMMAN: A new playground for Palestinian refugee children was opened on Monday using German funding through the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees. The money for the green play area was delivered after German FM Annalena Baerbock visited the Talbieh refugee camp earlier this month and met with students from Talbieh Girls’ School. Students spoke to Baerbock about their studies, goals and their desire for green areas, playgrounds and recreational spaces in the densely built and populated camp. “I am glad that we were able to provide this support — I am convinced that every child deserves a good school, and also one with a beautiful school yard,” German Ambassador to Jordan Bernhard Kampmann said. “With this project, we want to show that we see the people that UNRWA serves every day and the dedication of UNRWA staff: Teachers, doctors and the humanitarian personnel,” Kampmann added. In his speech, the ambassador also thanked the UNRWA for its support toward Palestinian refugees affected by the recent earthquakes: “Our hearts and thoughts are with those affected by the disastrous earthquakes in Turkey and Syria. We are grateful for UNRWA’s assistance to Palestine refugees — especially in times of hardship, but also every day here in Jordan.” Tamara Al-Rifai, director of external relations and communications at UNRWA, added: “We are thrilled to see a playground with trees and plants. “UNRWA is strongly advocating for greener camps and for recreational areas for camp residents, including children. “Here, it is the children’s right to play and to safety that Germany is directly supporting. It would be fantastic if similar green spaces were replicated across all UNRWA camps in the region.” The UNRWA is committed to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals. In 2022, Germany contributed about &euro;190 million ($200 million) to UNRWA operations.
