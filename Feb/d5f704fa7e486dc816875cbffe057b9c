DUBAI: The UAE’s permanent mission to the UN has hosted the UN Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs’ training on women, peace and security, Emirates News Agency reported on Sunday. The annual program aimed to increase participants’ understanding of the gendered effects of conflict while also providing tools to help women participate more effectively in conflict prevention and resolution, peace-building, and peace processes. The training was attended by nearly 30 people. Lana Nusseibeh, the UAE’s permanent representative to the UN, and Khaled Khiari, the UN assistant secretary-general for the Middle East, Asia, and the Pacific at the DPPA, jointly launched the event by outlining the UAE’s commitment to advancing the WPS agenda. “The UAE mission is always happy to serve as a space for face-to-face exchanges of opinion, especially when we are meeting about something as important as mainstreaming the WPS agenda,” Nusseibeh said. She continued: “This agenda has been a top priority for the UAE at the UN, and the Security Council, and beyond. Hosting this training is a way of showing our strong support for what UN DPPA has been doing on WPS. “WPS is a core political issue at the center of what the Security Council does. It is not an ‘add-on’ or ‘nice-to-have’ element … It is a foundation for sustainable peace and recovery. In this training, I hope you can draw valuable lessons and best practices so that we can all together give the WPS agenda the centrality it deserves.” The UAE is the first Arab country to host the event.
