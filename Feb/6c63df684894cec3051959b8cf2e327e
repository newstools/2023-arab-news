JEDDAH: Hissein Brahim Taha, secretary-general of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, addressed a high-level conference in support of Jerusalem at the headquarters of the Arab League in Cairo on Sunday.
It was attended by Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, Jordan’s King Abdullah II, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit.
Taha reiterated that the continued Israeli measures that target Islamic and Christian holy sites in Jerusalem are extremely dangerous.
He noted the international community’s responsibility to preserve the occupied city’s historical and legal status, especially the Al-Aqsa Mosque as the place of worship for Muslims alone.
Taha said the systematic Israeli attacks and violations in Jerusalem call for strengthening existing OIC and Arab League cooperation to provide political support for the holy city in international forums.
