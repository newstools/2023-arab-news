RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s Jeddah Islamic Port took two awards — one for Best Port in 2022 and the other for Digital Transformation — at the Green Shipping Summit in Rotterdam, the Saudi Press Agency reported on Thursday. The port was ranked eighth on the World Bank’s Container Port Efficiency Performance Index. The Kingdom’s port authority, known as Mawani, has worked to improve the facility’s operational capabilities and use of clean energy, including the establishment of five integrated logistics zones and the operation of 12 environmentally friendly cranes in its southern and northern container terminals. In addition, Mawani has heavily promoted the use of advanced digital technologies, including artificial intelligence, to automate Jeddah Islamic Port. It has also launched a port community management system, increasing the number of services available in Saudi ports from 46 to 150. The Green Shipping Summit aims to lead the maritime community toward an innovative, sustainable, carbon-neutral future.
