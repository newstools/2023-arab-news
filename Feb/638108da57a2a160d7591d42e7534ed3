RIYADH: The King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center signed two agreements on Thursday with the International Society for the Care of Victims of Wars and Disasters, on the sidelines of the Riyadh International Humanitarian Forum.
The first agreement initiated the launch of a mobile clinic system for those affected by the Syrian earthquake. Some 20 clinics will be stocked with medical and surgical supplies, as well as infant formula. The plan is expected to help more than 200,000 people.
The second deal calls for KSrelief and the Syrian refugee charity to provide health care as well as psychological, social, and nutritional support to 100,000 Syrian refugees in Lebanon.
The aid aims to support existing national tuberculosis and infectious disease programs, raise nutrition and hygiene awareness, help routine vaccination campaigns, and provide free medicines.
