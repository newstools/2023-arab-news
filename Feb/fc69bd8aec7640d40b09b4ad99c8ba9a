DUBAI: Snap Inc. has announced an exclusive partnership with MBC Media Solutions, the commercial arm of the MBC Group, to launch new augmented reality lenses for the first-ever season of “Saudi Idol.” Sara Abu Zahra, head of strategic media partnerships and programming for Snap Inc. in the Middle East and North Africa, said: “In a world where technology runs hand-in-hand with creativity, we are delighted to have developed these unique AR lenses for Snapchatters to engage with ‘Saudi Idol’ directly as they tune into the live show.” The new lenses include a so-called casting lens, inspired by the “Saudi Idol” auditions and which invites users to live the casting experience by singing to a panel of judges, and a live show lens, which allows users to sing in front of a panel of judges and receive feedback from them at the end of the performance. Moussa Abdo, digital lead at MMS, said: “It’s outstanding how AR is changing the advertising and marketing landscape, providing a new and interactive way for brands and businesses to engage with audiences by creating immersive and personalized experiences.” The Kingdom is one of Snapchat’s most-engaged markets, with the platform reaching more than 90 percent of 13 to 34-year-olds and a monthly addressable reach of 20 million users. The partnership marks Snapchat’s first initiative in the MENA region to launch AR lenses in collaboration with content partner entertainment shows. Abdo noted that MMS also planned similar partnerships in the future. “We look forward to exploring new and creative ways in partnering with Snapchat in the future so that viewers can have an immersive experience with MBC Group’s rich content,” he added.
