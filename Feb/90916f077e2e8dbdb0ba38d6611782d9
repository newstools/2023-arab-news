BUENOS AIRES: Top-seeded Carlos Alcaraz won his first title since his milestone US Open triumph by beating Cameron Norrie in straight sets at the Argentina Open on Sunday. For the latest updates, follow us on Twitter @ArabNewsSport The world No. 2 overcame No. 12 Norrie 6-3, 7-5 in the clay-court final. “I felt very comfortable,” Alcaraz said. “This is the level that I have to play in a final. It is really special, I struggled in these four months.” A right leg injury sidelined Alcaraz from the Australian Open, with Novak Djokovic reclaiming the No. 1 ranking from Alcaraz after winning the title there. The 19-year-old Alcaraz dropped only one set — to Serbia’s Laslo Djere — in his first tournament of the year. After winning the first set in 36 minutes, Alcaraz quickly broke second-seeded Norrie in the second set but the Briton hit back when the Spaniard was serving for the championship at 5-4. Alcaraz broke Norrie with a drop shot to win the title. Norrie lost his second final of the year after Auckland in January. Alcaraz next defends his title at the Rio Open.
