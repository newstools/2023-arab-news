MANCHESTER: Manchester United managers past and present will meet in the fifth round of the FA Cup on Wednesday. For the latest updates, follow us on Twitter @ArabNewsSport With a first trophy secured after winning the League Cup, Erik ten Hag has already surpassed David Moyes, who succeeded United great Alex Ferguson in 2013. Moyes, who lasted only eight months in the job before being fired, is back at Old Trafford with West Ham. He has, however, been impressed by Ten Hag’s impact at his former club, which has endured a decade of decline since Ferguson’s retirement. “I think he’s done a great job. I think Manchester United are a side which are used to success and I think that Manchester United are climbing the ladder back up toward where they want to be,” Moyes said. “I can only look from a distance and admire him for the good work he’s doing at Manchester United.” The League Cup triumph against Newcastle on Sunday ended United’s six-year trophy drought. And Ten Hag’s ambitions go much further after winning three Dutch league titles with Ajax before taking up the challenge of trying to return United to its former glory. His team is still in contention to win four trophies in his first season in charge and can progress to the quarterfinals of the FA Cup by beating West Ham. United has also advanced to the round of 16 in the Europa League and is in third place in the Premier League.
