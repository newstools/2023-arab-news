A post shared by Kevin Hart (@kevinhart4real)  The comedian also had his debut show in Egypt cancelled due to “logistical issues.” The news follows an outpouring of anger in the country over his alleged past comments in support of Afrocentrism.  A post shared by Kevin Hart (@kevinhart4real)  R Productions, the Egyptian event management company behind Hart’s tour, cited “local logistical issues” in a Facebook post on Monday that announced the cancellation. However, Hart faced a flood of criticism in the Arab world’s most populous country for reportedly advocating for children to learn about Africans as kings of ancient Egypt, rather than having them focus on the era of African enslavement in the US. Despite the uproar such comments caused among some netizens in Egypt, the alleged comments cannot be independently verified by Arab News.
