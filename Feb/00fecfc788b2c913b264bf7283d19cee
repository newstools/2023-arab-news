LONDON: The inaugural Qatar-UK Strategic Dialogue began in London this week. The talks, which got underway on Monday, were chaired by Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani, the Qatari minister of foreign affairs, and James Cleverly, the British secretary of state for foreign, commonwealth, and development affairs. The ministers highlighted the strong partnership between their countries, which they said allows them to address regional and global challenges together, the Qatar News Agency reported on Tuesday. They agreed to expand bilateral cooperation on a number of issues, including additional support for conflict deescalation and peace efforts in the Middle East, and the relief operation to help earthquake victims in Turkey and Syria. They reaffirmed their support for the Middle East peace process and a two-state solution to the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis based on 1967 lines, and their strong support for the historic status quo governing holy sites in Jerusalem. The participants emphasized their ongoing efforts to revive the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, also known as the Iran nuclear deal, officials said, and expressed concern about attacks and other activities designed to inflame tensions in the Gulf region, urging all parties to exercise restraint. They also agreed on the continuing need to provide humanitarian aid for the people of Afghanistan, without discrimination. They signed a memorandum of understanding outlining areas for bilateral cooperation in the realms of trade and investment, defense, security, counterterrorism efforts, foreign policy, climate change, energy, humanitarian and development assistance, conflict management, health, education and culture.
