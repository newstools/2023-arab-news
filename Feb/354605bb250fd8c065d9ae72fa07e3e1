RIYADH: The Saudi General Entertainment Authority recently launched the Entertainment Business Accelerator program to encourage entrepreneurs interested in the rapidly growing sector. The program aims to provide entrepreneurs with guidance and training, and link them with experts and consultants specialized in project development and a network of investors. Weekly training workshops, and individual advisory sessions between entrepreneurs and specialized consultants will be provided as part of the program. The program will also host speakers and owners of successful experiences, and organize daily activities between entrepreneurs and developers from the accelerator team. The accelerator will operate in two phases in its 12-week training program. Experts will monitor the performance of participants, support them in developing their projects, and help them prepare for the advanced investment rounds, where they will meet mentors weekly to develop their businesses. Project managers will contribute to the development of participants’ projects through guidance and mentoring programs, linking them with consultants, and following up on companies’ interactions with users and customers to understand their needs and develop their products according to market requirements. Mentors will set weekly goals for the projects and follow up on their development through agreed performance indicators. The work of the accelerator will conclude with the establishment of 24 projects that will be monitored periodically to ensure their continuity and growth.
