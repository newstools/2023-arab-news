Art, culture and the beauty of our home,” the designers said in a statement.   The new collection features long, lean and chic silhouettes.   The designers worked with a contrast of dense, opaque cloths and light transparencies to create a wardrobe inspired by the core inspiration of “shared” or “borrowed” pieces.   The designs feature column-cut cowl-front dresses. The designers also presented classic sailor collars on T-shirt-shaped shirts or tunics.
