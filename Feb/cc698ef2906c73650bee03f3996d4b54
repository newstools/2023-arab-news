Zelensky, who visited London on Wednesday, will make an opening address via video link, where he is set to repeat his opposition to the participation of the athletes in the wake of Russia’s invasion of his country, Britain’s Press Association reported.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) is looking at ways to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete as neutrals.
Ukraine has threatened to boycott the Games if that happens, with Zelensky calling the plans an attempt “to tell the whole world that terror is somehow acceptable.”
UK sports minister Lucy Frazer, who will chair Friday’s attempt to coordinate an international response, has urged the IOC to reconsider.
“President Zelensky told the UK in parliament this week of the suffering still being felt by many Ukrainians,” she said in a statement, according to the PA agency.
“As he did so the IOC was continuing to ignore the international allies stepping up their efforts for peace and disregard how the Olympics will give (Russian President Vladimir) Putin the perfect platform to promote Russia and legitimize his illegal war.
“We cannot allow Russian athletes to line up alongside Team GB and everyone else on the world stage,” Frazer added.
The Czech Republic, Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Poland and Sweden are among other countries opposed to the idea of Russian and Belarusian athletes competing under a neutral flag. For the latest updates, follow us on Twitter @ArabNewsSport
