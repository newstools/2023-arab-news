CAIRO: Customs authorities at Cairo International Airport recently foiled smuggling attempts involving items such as ammunition, bladed weapons, drones fitted with cameras, gold jewelry, and drugs. One passenger of Egyptian origin arriving on a Turkish Airlines flight from Istanbul was caught carrying 2,400 4.5-millimeter air-pressure bullets and two electronic devices, prohibited under Egyptian law without special permits. In another case, a passenger on an Egyptian Airlines flight from New York was found in possession of five penknives and an electric shock device, all of which were seized. The traveller also failed to declare two electronic cigarettes containing anesthetic oil and a bottle of the same oil, two wireless devices, and a pair of field glasses. Two drones equipped with cameras, 23 mobile phones, and eight tablets, were also seized. Legal action is being taken against both passengers. In addition, officials thwarted an individual, flying with Egyptian Airlines from Dubai, trying to sneak in gold jewelry hidden among clothes. The seized items, which weighed around 700 grams, included 20 chains, 27 pairs of earrings, three individual earrings, a bracelet, and a pendant. Separately, an Egyptian passenger arriving at Cairo from Milan on an Egyptian Airlines flight was arrested for having 602 tablets of illegal drugs. Another Egyptian, who had flown in from Entebbe in Uganda, also with Egyptian Airlines, was held after being discovered with 99 pills. Cairo airport customs staff also intercepted a passenger flying from New York hiding sweets and chocolate laced with drugs.
