LONDON: A man from South Wales in the UK has traveled more than 3,000 km to Turkiye in an effort to search for his family after Monday’s deadly earthquakes. Ahmat Yilmaz was discovered by a Sky News team at an airport in Turkiye’s Adiyaman province. He said he was traveling to search for family members who are still buried under rubble, and was making the trip to his childhood home in Tut village after hearing that his brother Ali had died in the earthquakes. Reporters offered to drive Yilmaz to the remote village, which is located on a treacherous mountain road. Upon arrival, he was greeted by his sister Fara and niece Sidka, who are likely the only surviving members of his family in the country. Standing in front of his destroyed childhood home, Yilmaz said the building had once been “full of joy and love.” He added: “It’s unbelievable. I’ve never seen this before. I’m really shocked. I’ve never seen this happen before in my life ... never.” Turkiye has said about 13.5 million people were affected by the earthquakes across a 450-km area.
