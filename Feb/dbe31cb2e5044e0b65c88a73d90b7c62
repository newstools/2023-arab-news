DUBAI: Streaming platform OSN+ has released its latest campaign titled “No More FOMO.” FOMO, or the fear of missing out, is an internet-age concept that was introduced in the early 2000s to describe a phenomenon observed primarily on social media: the perception of missing out on the latest content, events, milestones, travel, etc., and the need to participate in them. The term has since been casually used to describe feeling left out when someone misses out on a popular event or activity. OSN+’s campaign used the tagline “Watch What You’re Missing,” which aims to encourage audiences to discover all the must-see content available on the streaming platform. As part of the campaign, OSN+ is partnering with Arab celebrities starting with Saudi Arabian actress Aseel Omran and award-winning Egyptian director Omar El Zohairy, known for films such as “Zafir” and “Feathers.” “OSN+ is the platform of choice for passionate content lovers who rely on us for the latest trending series, and celebrities such as Aseel are no different,” said Ashley Rite, vice president of marketing and growth at OSN+. “Streaming has brought back the importance of being part of ‘must-see’ content, and with OSN+, everyone can avoid FOMO and watch what they’re missing.” The campaign also features an original song humorously depicting the dreaded FOMO effect, which has been picked up by TikTok creators. The launch video shows that even celebrities are not immune from the FOMO effect, particularly when it comes to missing out on the latest movie or TV show. Omran is the first celebrity to star in the campaign, with others to be unveiled soon.
