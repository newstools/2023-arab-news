RIYADH: The US-Gulf Cooperation Council Working Group on combating terror has underlined its long-standing partnership, and its determination to contribute to regional security and stability as part of a bilateral strategic partnership.
The pledge came in a joint statement following the meeting, which was held in Riyadh and attended by senior officials of the US and GCC members, reported the Kuwait News Agency on Friday.
The meeting focused on terrorism threats in the Middle East and other regions, including southern and central Asia and Africa.
Both sides condemned Iran’s destabilizing behavior, while agreeing that its support of terrorist and militant groups in the region — and its use of drone systems — posed a real threat to regional security and stability.
However, the parties added that diplomacy was the only way to deal with Tehran.
Those present stressed the need to do more through joint international efforts to thwart the resurgence of Daesh militants, and to find sustainable solutions to the problems of those languishing at camps and detention centers in northeastern Syria.
