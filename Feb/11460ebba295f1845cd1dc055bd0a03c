Riyadh: The National Center for Wildlife and the Saudi Water Sports and Diving Federation have signed a memorandum of understanding to enhance bilateral collaboration and work to protect the marine environment. The agreement was signed recently by Prince Sultan bin Fahd bin Salman, president of the federation, and Mohammed Ali Qurban, the CEO of the center. The MoU includes activities and campaigns for the rehabilitation of the marine and coastal environment, as well as coordinating joint responses to emergencies and disasters. The bodies have agreed to tackle poaching and illegal diving activities. They also plan to evaluate diving sites and provide training for instructors. Specialists on the marine environment told Arab News that the agreement would have a positive impact on efforts to protect the nation’s land and sea resources. Mohammed Alyahya, a professional diver who obtained an Advanced Open Water Diver license from the Professional Association of Diving Instructors, told Arab News he is involved in several awareness programs and is optimistic about the agreement. “This understanding is certainly reflected in the organization of events and the promotion of marine sports hobbies such as swimming, fishing and recreational diving.” Osama J. Qurban, chief executive of Environmental Balance Co., said the signing of the agreement would assist in creating awareness in the community and among sports practitioners of the importance of preserving marine habitats, especially coral reefs.
