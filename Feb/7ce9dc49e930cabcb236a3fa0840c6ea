DUBAI: The OpenAI tool, ChatGPT, has been controversially inspiring — and perhaps replacing — writers by generating everything from essays to advertisement taglines. The latest in its slew of skills is recipe creation. Dubai’s Dodo Pizza has created a new addition to their menu based on a recipe generated by the AI tool. Chef Spartak Arutyunyan entered “pizza for Dubai customers” and ChatGPT generated a recipe featuring lamb kofta on a thin and crispy crust with a tahini and sumac sauce.  A post shared by Dodo Pizza • Dubai (@dodopizza.uae) Arutyunyan made his own tweaks to the recipe, going with a traditional pizza sauce and replacing the lamb with chicken among other changes. This is not the first time the AI platform has thrown out recipes. Recently, Shubham Joshi, a digital creator from India, asked ChatGPT what he could make with some leftovers he had. The resulting recipe was a success with Joshi calling it quite “tasty.” Several users have turned to the AI platform to generate meal plans for themselves. While some applaud the platform, others are critical of the recipes it generates — especially with better websites available to help people create meal plans and find custom recipes. Dodo Pizza will offer the ChatGPT-inspired meal among others when the restaurant opens on Feb. 18 in Dubai Marina.
