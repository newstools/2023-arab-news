RIYADH: One of the greatest dangers posed by the development and growing use of artificial intelligence in society is that it diminishes the role of humans, according to Abdulrahman Al-Thabiti, a researcher in public administration. To illustrate his point, he talked about the detrimental effect AI could have on the job market. His warning came at the Saudi Media Forum in Riyadh on Monday, during a session titled “Media and the Ethical and Practical Implications of Artificial Intelligence.” The discussion centered on the ways in which AI might affect the ability of people to create and communicate. Al-Thabiti, who is studying for a doctorate and is an op-ed writer for the Jeddah-based Okaz newspaper, contrasted AI-generated content with the creative and supervisory value that is provided by human capabilities, arguing that AI systems lack transparency and accountability in this regard. He said AI cannot replace humans but expressed concern that it could nevertheless threaten the labor market by pushing down wages or eliminating some jobs altogether.
