RIYADH: Abu Dhabi’s ADNOC Drilling reported a rise of 33 percent in 2022 net profit, largely driven by new rigs entering its operational fleet. The company’s net profit for 2022 was $802 million, up from $604 million in the previous year. Revenue increased to $2.67 billion in 2022 from $2.27 billion in 2021. ADNOC Drilling also presented strong guidance for 2023, with revenue projected at between $3 billion and $3.2 billion, representing year-on-year growth of up to 20 percent, according to a press release. It is expecting a record net profit in 2023 of $850 million to $1 billion in the same period, the company said. ADNOC Drilling’s Chief Financial Officer Esa Ikaheimonen said in a post-earnings call that the forecasts are underpinned by ADNOC Group’s plans to bring forward its 5 million barrel per day oil production capacity expansion to 2027 from a previous target of 2030, to meet rising global energy demand. “That’s really what’s underpinning it because we as a drilling company are on a critical path in terms of achievement of those goals,” Ikaheimonen told Reuters. Emirates Steel Arkan’s 2022 net profit jumps to $138.4 million Buoyed by strong demand from international customers, Emirates Steel Arkan announced that its net profit rose to 508.5 million dirhams ($138.4 million) in 2022.

The group’s net profit for the full year 2022 was 508.5 million dirhams compared to a pro-forma loss of 636.7 million dirhams in the financial year 2021, supported by the group’s expansion of its international export footprint by 25 percent to 70 countries, from 56 in 2021.
